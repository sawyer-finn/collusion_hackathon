# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Market opened with wide price spread; bids clustered between $81.3-$83.7, asks between $96.43-$98.66; no trades yet; my bid at $82.55 was mid-range in bids.
#### Thoughts: The large spread indicates sellers are pricing much higher than buyers are willing to pay; opportunity to improve bid position slightly without sacrificing margin; no urgency to overpay early.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at $82.70, improving my position slightly in the bid queue. The market opened with a wide spread between bids (~$81.3-$83.7) and asks (~$96.43-$98.66), with no trades executed.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed slight upward movement with my new bid at $83.25, improving my rank but the ask prices remained high and no trades were executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $83.75, gaining better position near $83.8-$83.85 buyers, while asks remained high around $96.2-$97.7 with no trades executed.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $83.75, maintaining position below $84 in a bid queue clustered around mid $80s with ask prices steady near $96. No trades executed.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stable with bids clustered below $85; ask prices steady near $96; no trades executed indicating a wide spread and patient sellers. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $83.75 preserves profitability but delays trades; sellers show no sign of lowering asks; market patience remains key. Other buyers gradually raise bids but no breakthroughs. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bid at $83.75 to maintain competitive presence and profit margin; monitor for any drop in ask prices or bid changes; prepare to incrementally raise bid if spread narrows or market signals shift; ready to withdraw bid or reposition if necessary.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at $82.70, improving my position slightly in the bid queue. The market opened with a wide spread between bids (~$81.3-$83.7) and asks (~$96.43-$98.66), with no trades executed.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed slight upward movement with my new bid at $83.25, improving my rank but the ask prices remained high and no trades were executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $83.75, gaining better position near $83.8-$83.85 buyers, while asks remained high around $96.2-$97.7 with no trades executed.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $83.75, maintaining position below $84 in a bid queue clustered around mid $80s with ask prices steady near $96. No trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid and ask queues remained stable with no trades executed. I placed a bid at $83.75, maintaining my position near the lower mid-range of bids while sellers kept asks steady near $96.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue showed stable bids clustered below $85, with no change in ask prices near $96. I maintained my bid at $83.75, preserving position and margin with no trades executed.
Hour 7: Hour #7 shows continued stability in the bid queue with my bid at $83.75 remaining competitive but no trades executed; ask prices stayed firm near $96, maintaining a wide spread.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, the bid queue remained stable with my bid at $83.75 still near the lower mid-range; ask prices held firm near $96 with no trades executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue remains stable with bids mostly below $95 and ask prices steady near $96. I placed a bid at $84.25, slightly improving my position without triggering trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices still firm near $96, buyers slowly increasing bids; no trades; sellers patient. #### Thoughts: Incremental bids help maintain competitive position while managing profit margin; sellers not yielding. Time horizon shortening means need for stronger bids soon. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.00 to improve queue rank and pressure sellers, balancing margin and competitiveness; monitor ask prices closely; prepare for more aggressive bids in last hours if no trades occur.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers keep ask prices near $95.7-$95.8 despite some trades executed near these levels; buyers have bids ranging from mid $80s to low $90s; I am positioned below key buyers bidding near $90. #### Thoughts: Time is short with only one hour left; maintaining a bid far below ask prices means I risk no trades and zero profit; must balance margin with urgency to transact. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $89.50 this hour to improve queue ranking and approach recent trade prices; prepare to escalate bid closer to $90+ in final hour if no trade occurs; monitor ask prices and trades closely next hour to decide final bid.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

{
  "reflection": "Despite steadily increasing my bid from $82.70 in Hour 1 to $89.50 in Hour 14, I have not secured any trades. Other buyers have successfully transacted near the ask prices around $95.7-$95.8, indicating strong seller pricing and competitive buyer bids close to those levels. My bids remained below most active buyers who are bidding near or above $95.5, limiting my chances of matching sellers' asks. The wide spread between my bids and ask prices persisted until the last hours, reducing trading opportunities.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With only this final hour left, I must aggressively increase my bid to compete with the top buyers bidding near $95.7 to have a realistic chance of executing a trade. While this reduces my profit margin, securing a trade at a price near $95.7 is better than no trade and zero profit. I will place a bid at $95.70, matching the lowest ask prices, to improve my rank and increase trade likelihood. This is a strategic move to close the gap and finalize a deal before market close.",
  "bid": 95.7,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a bid at $95.70, matching the current lowest ask prices near $95.71-$95.76 to maximize chances of trade execution.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers keep ask prices near $95.7-$95.8 and buyers have bids clustered up to $95.7; no trades for me so far despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Time is critically short; maintaining bids below $90 did not produce trades; competing bids above $95.5 succeeded in trades at $95.7-$95.8. #### Updated Strategy: Place aggressive bid at $95.70 this hour to match lowest asks, accepting lower profit margin to secure at least one trade and avoid zero profit outcome."
