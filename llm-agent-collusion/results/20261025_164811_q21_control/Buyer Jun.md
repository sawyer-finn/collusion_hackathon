# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Highest bid is $83.61; lowest ask is $96.30; wide bid-ask spread (~$13).
- No trades yet, indicating sellers' prices are too high for buyers currently.

#### Thoughts
- Early market, likely to see gradual convergence of bids and asks.
- True value is $100, so room to increase bids later, but early aggressive bidding risks overpaying.

#### Updated Strategy
- Start with a bid slightly above highest bid to improve chances of trade.
- Monitor spread narrowing in coming hours to gradually increase bid towards true value.
- Avoid bidding too close to asks early to maintain profit margin.

- Lowest asks steady near 95.85 with no sign of dropping.
- No trades, spread remains large (~$9.55).
#### Thoughts
- Incremental bid increases are necessary to stay competitive.
- Sellers show no willingness to lower asks.
- Market is illiquid with a wide bid-ask spread.

- Continue slow upward bid increments while monitoring ask prices closely.
- Avoid large bid jumps early to preserve profit margins.
- Prepare to accelerate bid increases as later hours approach if asks remain stubborn to facilitate trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid now $87.00 by others; my bid at $86.3 was just below highest. Asks stable near $95.84 with no trade activity. Spread remains wide (~$8.7).
#### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep me competitive but no sellers are lowering asks. The market is illiquid with wide spread deterring trades.
#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally above highest bid by $0.10 to maintain queue priority. Monitor asks for any downward movement. Prepare for larger bid increments in future hours if asks do not soften to ensure trades happen by hour 15.

#### Thoughts: Incremental increases keep me competitive but no seller concession. Spread too wide to expect immediate trades. Need to gradually increase bid to pressure sellers or wait for ask drop.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid now $87.5 shared by several buyers; my last bid was $87.35, just below this. Asks remain steady near $95.82, no trades yet. Spread still wide (~$8.25). Market remains illiquid with sellers holding firm. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but no seller concession yet. Spread too wide for immediate trades. Need to push bids just above highest to keep priority and pressure sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid by $0.10 above highest bid to $87.60 to secure top position. Monitor for any ask price drops. Prepare to increase bid more aggressively if asks remain firm in future hours to ensure trades before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Cobalt Drone Works as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Cobalt Drone Works as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid now $88.00 by me, ask prices steady near $95.8, spread remains wide (~$7.8), no trades yet, market illiquid. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases maintain priority but lack seller concessions; spread only slightly narrowed; slow pace risks no trades before hour 15. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid by +$0.15 to $88.00 to signal stronger buying interest and potentially pressure sellers; continue monitoring asks closely; aim for a balance between profit margin and timely trade execution as deadline approaches.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid increased to $88.50 last hour with no trades; spread remains wide around $7.3 and sellers hold firm near $95.8; buyer competition growing with bids near $91. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintained priority but failed to prompt trades or ask reductions; risk of no transactions if spread remains unchanged; sellers show no concession signs. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid by $0.75 to $89.25 to signal stronger buying demand and pressure sellers; stay below true value of $100 to preserve profit margin; closely monitor market reaction this hour for potential ask drops or trades; prepare to make more aggressive bids in last hours if needed to secure trades before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Cobalt Drone Works as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Highest bid increased to $89.25 last hour; ask prices remain firm near $95.8; no trades yet despite rising bids; buyer competition intense with bids near $91; wide spread persists. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain priority but fail to induce trades or ask concessions; risk of no trades before market close; sellers hold firm. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $89.75 to signal stronger demand and pressure sellers; avoid bidding near true value to preserve margin; closely monitor market response for ask reductions or trades; prepare to make more aggressive bids in final two hours if needed to secure trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Cobalt Drone Works as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid now $90.25 by me, with several buyers bidding near or above $90; ask prices remain firmly around $95.75-$95.84; no trades yet despite rising bids; wide bid-ask spread persists. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain priority and signal stronger demand but sellers hold firm; risk of no trades before close remains; sellers appear reluctant to reduce asks given current bids. #### Updated Strategy: Moderate bid increase to $90.25 to pressure sellers while preserving margin; monitor market response closely; prepare for more aggressive bids in Hour 15 to secure trades if necessary; avoid bids near true value unless forced by market conditions.
