# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster around 83-85, asks remain high near 96-99; no trades yet. Incremental bid increases show buying interest but no seller concessions so far. #### Thoughts: Patience is key early to avoid margin erosion; steady bid increases are needed to signal seriousness but avoid overshooting. Sellers currently resist lowering asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately each hour to gradually narrow spread, aiming to reach trades near 90-95 in mid-game; watch for any ask price drops as a signal to accelerate bidding or secure trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Rosa. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 83.65, which is above the current highest bids but still below the lowest ask prices. No trades occurred yet, and the market opened with a bid-ask spread of roughly 82.4 to 96.3.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 84.25 to inch closer to the ask prices, aiming to narrow the wide bid-ask spread and encourage sellers to reconsider their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered just below 85 while asks stayed stubbornly high near 96 to 98. I raised my bid to 84.85 to continue nudging the market without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I raised my bid to 85.40, slightly above my previous 84.85, continuing the pattern of incremental increases. The bid queue remains clustered around 84-86.5, and asks persist near the 95.85-98.66 range with no trades yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid clusters remain mid-80s, sellers steadfast near mid-90s, no trades after steady bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong ask price resistance; incremental bid increases haven't narrowed the spread enough to induce trades. A more assertive bid increase is needed to test seller limits and potentially accelerate market convergence. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately above current buyer cluster to $87.15 to signal stronger buying power without compromising profitability. Monitor ask responses closely next hour; be ready to increase bids further if no ask concessions occur or withdraw if market conditions worsen. Maintain balance between profit margin and trade likelihood.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Rosa. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 83.65, which is above the current highest bids but still below the lowest ask prices. No trades occurred yet, and the market opened with a bid-ask spread of roughly 82.4 to 96.3.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 84.25 to inch closer to the ask prices, aiming to narrow the wide bid-ask spread and encourage sellers to reconsider their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered just below 85 while asks stayed stubbornly high near 96 to 98. I raised my bid to 84.85 to continue nudging the market without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I raised my bid to 85.40, slightly above my previous 84.85, continuing the pattern of incremental increases. The bid queue remains clustered around 84-86.5, and asks persist near the 95.85-98.66 range with no trades yet.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $87.15, surpassing the highest nearby bids around $87.0 and edging closer to the ask prices. The ask queue remains firm above $95.84 with no trades yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at $87.50, raising above the prior highest bids to strengthen my position. The bid queue remains clustered below $87.50, and asks are still firmly above $95.8 with no trades occurring.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains below 88, asks still firm above 95.8, no trades so far despite incremental increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong price resistance; minor bid raises insufficient to close spread. A more aggressive bid increase necessary to influence ask prices and induce trades. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $89.50 to demonstrate stronger buying intent, narrowing the gap with asks. Monitor any shifts in ask prices or trade activity closely. Prepare to further raise bids if no progress, balancing profitability and urgency as time horizon shortens.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Rosa. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 83.65, which is above the current highest bids but still below the lowest ask prices. No trades occurred yet, and the market opened with a bid-ask spread of roughly 82.4 to 96.3.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 84.25 to inch closer to the ask prices, aiming to narrow the wide bid-ask spread and encourage sellers to reconsider their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered just below 85 while asks stayed stubbornly high near 96 to 98. I raised my bid to 84.85 to continue nudging the market without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I raised my bid to 85.40, slightly above my previous 84.85, continuing the pattern of incremental increases. The bid queue remains clustered around 84-86.5, and asks persist near the 95.85-98.66 range with no trades yet.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $87.15, surpassing the highest nearby bids around $87.0 and edging closer to the ask prices. The ask queue remains firm above $95.84 with no trades yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at $87.50, raising above the prior highest bids to strengthen my position. The bid queue remains clustered below $87.50, and asks are still firmly above $95.8 with no trades occurring.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $89.50, surpassing the previous top bids of $87.50, aiming to challenge the ask prices around $95.8. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $90.50, maintaining the highest buy position and attempting to narrow the gap with the ask prices still above $95.8. No trades occurred yet.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 83.65, which is above the current highest bids but still below the lowest ask prices. No trades occurred yet, and the market opened with a bid-ask spread of roughly 82.4 to 96.3.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 84.25 to inch closer to the ask prices, aiming to narrow the wide bid-ask spread and encourage sellers to reconsider their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered just below 85 while asks stayed stubbornly high near 96 to 98. I raised my bid to 84.85 to continue nudging the market without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I raised my bid to 85.40, slightly above my previous 84.85, continuing the pattern of incremental increases. The bid queue remains clustered around 84-86.5, and asks persist near the 95.85-98.66 range with no trades yet.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $87.15, surpassing the highest nearby bids around $87.0 and edging closer to the ask prices. The ask queue remains firm above $95.84 with no trades yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at $87.50, raising above the prior highest bids to strengthen my position. The bid queue remains clustered below $87.50, and asks are still firmly above $95.8 with no trades occurring.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $89.50, surpassing the previous top bids of $87.50, aiming to challenge the ask prices around $95.8. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $90.50, maintaining the highest buy position and attempting to narrow the gap with the ask prices still above $95.8. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I kept my bid at $90.50, retaining the highest buy position while the ask queue remains stubbornly above $95.8, and no trades occurred again.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices remain firmly above 95.8 with no downward movement; bid cluster mostly below 88 except my bid at 90.5; no trades after multiple incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not budging despite persistent bid pressure; wide bid-ask spread continues to block trades; buyers are not pushing high enough to force sellers down. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $90.50 this hour to signal strong buying interest and maintain highest position; watch for any seller ask adjustments; prepare to increase bid in small increments in coming hours to balance urgency and profitability as deadline approaches.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices remain firmly above 95.79 with no downward movement; my bid at 90.50 is highest by a comfortable margin; no trades after sustained bid pressure. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yielding despite strong buying signals; wide spread persists, blocking transactions; market appears sticky on seller ask side. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 90.50 this hour to maintain strong buying presence; avoid aggressive jumps that reduce profit margins prematurely; observe seller behavior closely; plan small incremental bid increases if no trades occur in next hours, balancing urgency and profitability as deadline approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Rosa. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 83.65, which is above the current highest bids but still below the lowest ask prices. No trades occurred yet, and the market opened with a bid-ask spread of roughly 82.4 to 96.3.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 84.25 to inch closer to the ask prices, aiming to narrow the wide bid-ask spread and encourage sellers to reconsider their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered just below 85 while asks stayed stubbornly high near 96 to 98. I raised my bid to 84.85 to continue nudging the market without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I raised my bid to 85.40, slightly above my previous 84.85, continuing the pattern of incremental increases. The bid queue remains clustered around 84-86.5, and asks persist near the 95.85-98.66 range with no trades yet.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $87.15, surpassing the highest nearby bids around $87.0 and edging closer to the ask prices. The ask queue remains firm above $95.84 with no trades yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at $87.50, raising above the prior highest bids to strengthen my position. The bid queue remains clustered below $87.50, and asks are still firmly above $95.8 with no trades occurring.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $89.50, surpassing the previous top bids of $87.50, aiming to challenge the ask prices around $95.8. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $90.50, maintaining the highest buy position and attempting to narrow the gap with the ask prices still above $95.8. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I kept my bid at $90.50, retaining the highest buy position while the ask queue remains stubbornly above $95.8, and no trades occurred again.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I kept my bid steady at $90.50, maintaining the highest bid position. The ask queue remained stubborn above $95.79 with no trades occurring again.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I kept my bid steady at 90.50, maintaining the highest buy position. The ask queue remained stubbornly high above 95.78, and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks above 95.77; no trades despite highest bid at 90.50; bid queue clustered below 90.50 except my bid; competing bids remain below 91.0. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance; incremental bid increases below 91 have not closed gap; urgency to trade increases as deadline nears but profit margins must be preserved; market appears sticky on ask side. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 90.50 this hour to maintain strong presence and avoid margin erosion; watch for any signs of seller movement or competitive bid increases; prepare to increase bid in small increments in next hours if no trades occur, balancing profit margin with trade urgency before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Rosa. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 83.65, which is above the current highest bids but still below the lowest ask prices. No trades occurred yet, and the market opened with a bid-ask spread of roughly 82.4 to 96.3.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 84.25 to inch closer to the ask prices, aiming to narrow the wide bid-ask spread and encourage sellers to reconsider their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered just below 85 while asks stayed stubbornly high near 96 to 98. I raised my bid to 84.85 to continue nudging the market without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I raised my bid to 85.40, slightly above my previous 84.85, continuing the pattern of incremental increases. The bid queue remains clustered around 84-86.5, and asks persist near the 95.85-98.66 range with no trades yet.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $87.15, surpassing the highest nearby bids around $87.0 and edging closer to the ask prices. The ask queue remains firm above $95.84 with no trades yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at $87.50, raising above the prior highest bids to strengthen my position. The bid queue remains clustered below $87.50, and asks are still firmly above $95.8 with no trades occurring.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $89.50, surpassing the previous top bids of $87.50, aiming to challenge the ask prices around $95.8. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $90.50, maintaining the highest buy position and attempting to narrow the gap with the ask prices still above $95.8. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I kept my bid at $90.50, retaining the highest buy position while the ask queue remains stubbornly above $95.8, and no trades occurred again.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I kept my bid steady at $90.50, maintaining the highest bid position. The ask queue remained stubborn above $95.79 with no trades occurring again.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I kept my bid steady at 90.50, maintaining the highest buy position. The ask queue remained stubbornly high above 95.78, and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I maintained my bid at $90.50, continuing to hold the highest bid position. Sellers remained firm with asks still above $95.77, and no trades occurred again.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I maintained my bid at 90.50, continuing to hold the highest bid position. Sellers remained firm with asks still above 95.76, and no trades occurred.

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain above $95.75, no trades despite highest bid increase to $91.00; bid-ask spread still wide but slightly narrower. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase necessary to push market closer to trade execution; urgency increased with only one hour left; profit margins still acceptable with $91 bid. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.00 this hour to signal stronger buying intent; prepare for a possible final bid adjustment next hour if no trades occur; aim to secure at least one trade before hour 15 while maintaining profitability.

{
  "reflection": "Despite steadily increasing my bid from $83.65 to $91.00 over 15 hours, no trades have occurred due to sellers maintaining asks above $95.75, indicating strong seller resistance and a persistent wide bid-ask spread. Incremental increases preserved profitability but failed to bridge the gap sufficiently for a trade.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will increase my bid more aggressively to $93.00, still below my true value of $100.00 but significantly higher than before, to maximize the chance of securing at least one trade and avoiding ending the session empty-handed.",
  "bid": 93.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $93.00, surpassing previous highest bids to aggressively signal buying intent. Sellers' asks remained stubborn above $95.74, and no trades occurred this hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers' asks continue above $95.74 with no trades despite my bid increases up to $91.00; bid-ask spread remains wide; final hour urgency is critical. #### Thoughts: Prior incremental increases were too cautious to close gap; must balance profitability with securing a trade now. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid aggressively to $93.00 this hour to maximize trade probability; still below my $100 true value to retain some margin; prepare for no further bids as this is last hour; accept lower profit margin for securing trade."
