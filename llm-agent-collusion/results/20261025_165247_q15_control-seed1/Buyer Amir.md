# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81-83 and asks around 96-98. I placed a bid at 83.85, slightly above the highest current bid of 83.67, to position myself competitively for future trades.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue is tightly clustered below 84.10, and the ask queue remains high near 96-98. I raised my bid from 83.85 to 84.10 to stay competitive at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remained competitive with my bid at 84.10, still the highest among buyers. Sellers’ ask prices remain high around 96-98 with no trades executed.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid at 84.10 near the top, while the ask queue remains firmly above 96 with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at 84.10.

Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remained competitive with my bid at 84.10, still the highest among buyers. Sellers’ ask prices remain high around 96-98 with no trades executed.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid at 84.10 near the top, while the ask queue remains firmly above 96 with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at 84.10.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows increased clustering above 84 with multiple buyers at 84.3, but I maintain my bid at 84.10, staying competitive near the top. Seller asks remain high near 96-98, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with cluster bids ranging 83.93 to 84.4, sellers keep asks high near 96.15 to 97.96, and I kept my bid steady at 84.10.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered above 84 with multiple buyers bidding up to 84.4; sellers maintain asks near 96.15-97.96; no trades despite persistent bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear unwilling to lower ask prices at this stage; maintaining bid at 84.10 keeps me competitive without sacrificing margin; incremental bid increases so far have not influenced sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 84.10 this hour to continue monitoring seller behavior; prepare to incrementally increase bid after a few more hours if seller asks remain firm; balance need to secure trades by Hour 15 with goal of maximizing profit.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain steady above 96, no trades yet; bid queue competitive with bids from 83.95 to 85.0; my bid steady at 84.10 near top. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no sign of lowering asks; holding bid maintains position without eroding margin; rivals are bidding higher but still below seller asks. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.10 this hour to hold competitive position and preserve margin; watch closely for any shifts in ask prices; plan to raise bid incrementally if asks remain high as final hours approach to balance trade execution with profitability.

Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with cluster bids ranging 83.93 to 84.4, sellers keep asks high near 96.15 to 97.96, and I kept my bid steady at 84.10.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered above 84 with multiple buyers bidding up to 84.45. Sellers continue to hold ask prices high near 96.14-97.96. I maintained my bid at 84.10.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, seller asks remain high around 96.13-97.96 with no trades executed. The bid queue is competitive with bids up to 85.0, and I maintained my bid at 84.10.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, seller asks stay high around 96.12 to 97.96 with no trades, while bid prices cluster up to 85.0. I raised my bid from 84.10 to 84.50 to stay competitive.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain stubbornly high near 96+, preventing trades; bid queue now clusters up to 85.1, with incremental bid increases by competitors; no trades have occurred yet despite bids rising. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not conceding, so aggressive bidding is needed to approach a trade, but must balance against preserving profit margins; incremental bid increases are effective to maintain top queue position; monitor seller ask prices closely for any softening. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to slightly above highest current bid (85.1) to 85.15 this hour to stay competitive; prepare to raise bids further in small increments if asks do not fall; watch for any seller concessions; balance urgency to secure trades with profitability as market nears final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue is tightly clustered below 84.10, and the ask queue remains high near 96-98. I raised my bid from 83.85 to 84.10 to stay competitive at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remained competitive with my bid at 84.10, still the highest among buyers. Sellers’ ask prices remain high around 96-98 with no trades executed.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid at 84.10 near the top, while the ask queue remains firmly above 96 with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at 84.10.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows increased clustering above 84 with multiple buyers at 84.3, but I maintain my bid at 84.10, staying competitive near the top. Seller asks remain high near 96-98, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with cluster bids ranging 83.93 to 84.4, sellers keep asks high near 96.15 to 97.96, and I kept my bid steady at 84.10.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered above 84 with multiple buyers bidding up to 84.45. Sellers continue to hold ask prices high near 96.14-97.96. I maintained my bid at 84.10.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, seller asks remain high around 96.13-97.96 with no trades executed. The bid queue is competitive with bids up to 85.0, and I maintained my bid at 84.10.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, seller asks stay high around 96.12 to 97.96 with no trades, while bid prices cluster up to 85.0. I raised my bid from 84.10 to 84.50 to stay competitive.
Hour 10: Hour #10: Bid queue has bids clustered up to 85.1 with my bid at 85.0 previously; seller asks remain firm around 96.12-97.96; I raised my bid to 85.15 to maintain competitiveness near the top.
Hour 11: At Hour #11, the bid queue remains clustered with the highest bids around 85.15; seller asks persist near 96.11-97.96 with no trades. I increased my bid from 85.15 to 85.20 to maintain a top position and attempt to nudge the market closer to a trade.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firmly above 96 with no downward movement, preventing trades. Bid queue remains competitive, clustered near 85.20. Incremental bid increases have maintained top position but no trades occurred. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yielding despite persistent top bids; the spread is too wide for trades. A slightly more aggressive bid may pressure sellers, but caution is needed to preserve profit margin. Time is limited with only 3 hours remaining. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly from 85.20 to 85.25 to continue applying pressure while preserving margin. Watch for any seller ask reductions or trades next hour. Prepare to increase bids in small increments if asks remain unchanged, balancing urgency and profitability as final hours approach.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks continue unchanged near 96.11-97.96 with no trades despite bids clustered tightly at 85.2-85.3; sellers show strong resistance to lowering asks, preserving the wide spread. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have maintained a top position but not induced trades; sellers are holding firm, likely waiting for buyers to raise bids significantly. With only one hour left, urgency to secure trades increases but must balance profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.30 this hour to preserve top competitiveness without sacrificing margin prematurely. If no trade occurs by hour 15, prepare to increase bid moderately to push sellers closer while minimizing profit loss. Stay alert for any shift in ask prices.

{
  "reflection": "Despite consistently maintaining top bid positions and incrementally increasing bids, no trades have occurred due to sellers' steadfast ask prices near 96.1-97.9, which remain far above buyers' maximum bids around 85.3-85.6. My conservative bid increases preserved margin but failed to induce any seller concessions or trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I must increase my bid more significantly to close the gap and secure at least one trade while limiting margin erosion. I will raise my bid to 86.00 to improve competitiveness and signal increased willingness to pay, balancing urgency with profitability.",
  "bid": 86.0,
  "new_memory": "At Hour #15, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustered up to 85.6, and seller asks continue to hold near 96.1-97.96. I raised my bid from 85.3 to 86.00 to improve chances of trade execution in the last hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Final hour pressure to execute trades grows; seller asks remain stubbornly high with no concessions; bids cluster just below 85.6 but no trades; previous incremental bid increases were insufficient. #### Thoughts: Market spread too wide to expect trades without meaningful bid increase; last hour demands stronger action to secure trades; balancing increased bid with acceptable profit margin is critical. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to 86.00 to signal readiness to pay more and attempt to induce sellers to lower ask or accept current bids; monitor for any trade; if no trade occurs, bid removal is pointless as this is final hour."
