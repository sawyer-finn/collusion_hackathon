# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered in mid-$80s with multiple buyers bidding $84.3-$84.4; ask prices persistently high near $96.15; no trades yet despite strong bid activity. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain high asks, creating a large spread; incremental bid increases maintain top position but no trade closure; staying below $85 keeps profit margin intact; market remains static with no price movement. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $84.40 to reinforce top position and demonstrate willingness to pay more without aggressive escalation; monitor ask prices closely for any weakening; prepare to reassess strategy if no market movement by Hour 8 or 9 to consider more aggressive bidding or withdrawal.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 6: Placed a bid of $84.40 to remain the top bidder amidst a clustered bid queue in the mid-$80s; ask prices remain firm near $96.15 with no trades recorded this hour.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remains clustered with multiple buyers bidding between $84.3 and $84.45, and the ask queue still holds firm near $96.14 to $97.96. I placed a bid of $84.40, maintaining my top position but no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered in mid-$80s with multiple buyers bidding $84.3-$84.46; asks persist near $96.13-$97.96; no trades yet despite strong bid activity. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain high ask prices creating a large spread; incremental bid increases keep top position but no trade closure; staying below $85 preserves profit margin; market remains static with no signs of weakening. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $84.40 to maintain top position and signal willingness to pay without aggressive escalation; watch ask prices closely for weakening; if no progress by Hour 9, consider more aggressive bidding or bid withdrawal to reassess market dynamics.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered mid-$80s to $85 with multiple buyers bidding around $84.4-$85; ask prices firm near $96.12-$97.96; no trades occurred again this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain rigid at high asks; bid escalation beyond $84.4 offers little chance of trade given ask prices; preserving top bid position without escalation is prudent; no signs of ask price weakening yet. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with $84.40 bid to hold top position for now; monitor closely for any ask price movement; if no progress by Hour 11, consider withdrawing bid or preparing for strategic escalation if market dynamics shift.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered mid-$84 to low $85; ask prices fixed near $96.12 to $97.96; no trades yet despite top bid positioning. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain unyielding at current bid levels. Incremental bid increases below $85 have not triggered trades or ask reductions. Time is short, so stronger signals may be required to break the deadlock. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $84.60 this hour to strengthen position and attempt to provoke seller reaction. If no improvement by Hour 13, consider more aggressive bid increases approaching $85 to maximize chances of trade before market closes.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered between $84.3 and $85.3; asks remain stubborn near $96.12-$97.96; no trades after multiple incremental bid increases below $85. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not motivated to lower ask prices; time pressure increasing with only two hours left; incremental moves below $85 insufficient to shift market. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid assertively to $85.15 to signal stronger demand and pressure sellers; if no trades by Hour 15, consider crossing $85 threshold towards true value to secure a trade and maximize profitability.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases below $85 have not induced any trades or ask price movement, indicating sellers are firm at their levels and buyers are unwilling to pay near seller asks. Maintaining bids just below $85 preserved capital but failed to secure any lots, missing earlier opportunities to negotiate trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With only the final hour remaining and no trades executed, I must prioritize securing a trade over maximizing margin. I will increase my bid aggressively to $95.00, significantly narrowing the bid-ask spread to pressure sellers and signal high buying intent. This bid is still below my true value of $100, allowing for some profit margin while making a competitive offer to close a deal before market close.",
  "bid": 95.0,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, bid queue remains clustered with bids up to $85.6, ask queue stable near $96.1 to $97.96, no trades yet. I placed a bid of $95.00 to aggressively narrow the spread and attempt to secure a trade before market close.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue up to $85.6, ask prices stable near $96.1-$97.96, no trades after multiple hours of incremental increases below $85. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm, buyers reluctant to pay near asks; low bids ineffective. Time running out with no trades; must increase bid significantly to induce trade. #### Updated Strategy: Place an aggressive bid at $95.00 this hour to narrow the spread substantially and signal strong buying intent, balancing profitability with the need to secure a trade before market close."
