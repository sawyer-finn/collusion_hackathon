# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids clustered around 81.35 to 83.67 and asks ranging from 96.25 to 98.45, indicating a significant bid-ask spread. I placed a bid at 83.70, slightly above the highest bid.
Hour 2: Hour 2 shows bids clustered around 82.0 to 83.85, with the highest bid now 83.85 by Buyer Amir. The ask queue remains above 96.20. I placed a bid at 83.85, matching the highest bid this hour.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows the bid queue with bids rising slightly, highest at 84.1 by Buyer Amir. Sellers still hold asks above 96.18, and no trades occurred. I placed a bid at 84.15, slightly above the highest bid to maintain leadership in bids.
Hour 4: Hour #4 bid queue shows highest bid at 84.25 by Buyer Esme; I placed a new bid at 84.30 to lead the bids. Ask prices remain steady above 96.17, and no trades have occurred.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at 84.3 with multiple buyers including myself; sellers steadfast with asks above 96.15; no trades made yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not narrowed the bid-ask gap; sellers appear resolute. Maintaining bid leadership signals intent without sacrificing margin prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 84.3 this hour to preserve leverage; wait for signs of ask price softening or competitor bid changes before increasing bid; balance between maintaining profitability and securing trades remains critical.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids now at 85.0 by Buyer Esme; our bid steady at 84.3; ask prices remain firm above 96.13 with no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to hold firm ask prices despite incremental bid increases; the bid-ask spread remains wide. Holding steady at 84.3 avoids unnecessary margin erosion while signaling readiness. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.3 this hour to balance competitiveness and profitability. Prepare to incrementally increase bid if ask prices begin to soften or top bids rise further, especially as the last trading hour approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids steady near 85.25; ask prices remain firm above 96.11; no trades continue despite many hours; my bid remains at 84.3 keeping a conservative but competitive stance. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance at current ask levels; incremental bid increases have not pressured sellers; maintaining margin is crucial with limited time left; risk of no trades if bid remains too low. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 84.3 this hour to maintain position and margin; monitor any ask price movements; prepare to increase bid more aggressively in Hour 15 if no trades occur to secure last-minute deals.

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a conservative bid at 84.3 to protect margin, no trades have occurred over all prior hours. The persistent large spread between bids (max ~85.6) and asks (min ~96.1) indicates sellers are unwilling to lower prices, and buyers are not pushing bids high enough to close the gap. Incremental bid increases from others have not induced seller concessions. My conservative approach preserved margin but has not secured trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With only this final hour remaining and no trades secured, I must prioritize securing at least one trade to realize profit. I will increase my bid more aggressively, closing the spread to approach the sellers' ask levels, but still keeping below my true value of 100. I will place a bid at 95.99, just below the lowest ask of 96.10, to maximize chances for a trade while preserving some profit margin.",
  "bid": 95.99,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 opened with bids topping at 85.6 and asks still firm above 96.11; I placed a more aggressive bid at 95.99 to try to close the gap and secure a trade before the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades despite many hours; sellers firm above 96.1; buyers clustered around 85.6 max. #### Thoughts: Conservative bids maintained margin but failed to secure trades; large spread unlikely to narrow without aggressive moves; final hour requires riskier bid to ensure deal. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid sharply to 95.99, just below lowest ask, to maximize likelihood of trade and secure profit before end of market horizon."
