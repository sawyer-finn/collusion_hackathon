# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.70, just above the highest existing bid of $83.67, positioning myself competitively in the bid queue without sacrificing profit margin.
Hour 2: Placed bid at $83.90, slightly above the highest bid of $83.85 to gain a more competitive position in the bid queue while maintaining a healthy margin from asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $83.95, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.9, to maintain a competitive position amid a persistent large spread with asks around $96.19.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the highest bid moved up to $84.15 by others while ask prices remained around $96.17 to $97.96. I placed a bid at $84.00 to remain competitive just below the crowd's top bids.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices continue gradual increments with top bids around $84.4; ask prices remain stable and high near $96.15, maintaining a wide spread. No trades yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain strong ask prices, and buyers are incrementally increasing bids but have not pressured sellers into lowering ask prices or triggered trades. The wide spread limits trade opportunities. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain a bid slightly above the highest current bid ($84.4) to stay competitive without conceding too much margin. Monitor ask prices for any decrease. Prepare to increase bids more aggressively if ask prices do not come down or if approaching final hours, to secure trades balancing profitability and trade completion.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.70, just above the highest existing bid of $83.67, positioning myself competitively in the bid queue without sacrificing profit margin.
Hour 2: Placed bid at $83.90, slightly above the highest bid of $83.85 to gain a more competitive position in the bid queue while maintaining a healthy margin from asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $83.95, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.9, to maintain a competitive position amid a persistent large spread with asks around $96.19.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the highest bid moved up to $84.15 by others while ask prices remained around $96.17 to $97.96. I placed a bid at $84.00 to remain competitive just below the crowd's top bids.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the highest bid rose to $84.3 by multiple buyers while asks remain above $96. I placed a bid at $84.40, slightly above the current highest bid to maintain a competitive edge.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $84.45, slightly above the highest current bid of $84.4 to maintain competitive positioning amid stable ask prices near $96.15.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the highest bids remained clustered at 84.45 with asks stable near 96.14; I placed a bid at 84.46, slightly above the highest bid to maintain competitive queue position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids remain clustered around $84.45-$84.5; asks stable near $96.13; no trades yet; spread still wide. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no signs of reducing asks; buyers are cautious with incremental bid increases; maintaining a top position is key but trades unlikely at current spread. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $84.46 to hold a competitive position without eroding margins; prepare to increase bids more substantially if no ask reduction or trades occur in next few hours; evaluate market dynamics closely after Hour #10 to decide on aggressive bidding or withdrawal.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $83.95, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.9, to maintain a competitive position amid a persistent large spread with asks around $96.19.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the highest bid moved up to $84.15 by others while ask prices remained around $96.17 to $97.96. I placed a bid at $84.00 to remain competitive just below the crowd's top bids.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the highest bid rose to $84.3 by multiple buyers while asks remain above $96. I placed a bid at $84.40, slightly above the current highest bid to maintain a competitive edge.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $84.45, slightly above the highest current bid of $84.4 to maintain competitive positioning amid stable ask prices near $96.15.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the highest bids remained clustered at 84.45 with asks stable near 96.14; I placed a bid at 84.46, slightly above the highest bid to maintain competitive queue position.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $84.46, maintaining a slight lead over the highest bids at $84.45, while asks remained steady near $96.13, and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of $84.52, slightly above the highest existing bid of $84.51, to maintain competitive queue positioning amid stable asks around $96.12-$96.72 and no trades yet.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered around $84.5; asks stable near $96.11-$96.72; no trades yet, indicating persistent wide spread and seller resistance. #### Thoughts: Maintaining top bid position preserves margin but no trade progress; sellers unwilling to lower ask prices; buyers not aggressive enough to close spread. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $84.52 to hold competitive position without margin sacrifice; closely watch ask price movements; prepare to increase bids aggressively or withdraw if no market improvement by Hour #11.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.70, just above the highest existing bid of $83.67, positioning myself competitively in the bid queue without sacrificing profit margin.
Hour 2: Placed bid at $83.90, slightly above the highest bid of $83.85 to gain a more competitive position in the bid queue while maintaining a healthy margin from asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $83.95, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.9, to maintain a competitive position amid a persistent large spread with asks around $96.19.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the highest bid moved up to $84.15 by others while ask prices remained around $96.17 to $97.96. I placed a bid at $84.00 to remain competitive just below the crowd's top bids.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the highest bid rose to $84.3 by multiple buyers while asks remain above $96. I placed a bid at $84.40, slightly above the current highest bid to maintain a competitive edge.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $84.45, slightly above the highest current bid of $84.4 to maintain competitive positioning amid stable ask prices near $96.15.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the highest bids remained clustered at 84.45 with asks stable near 96.14; I placed a bid at 84.46, slightly above the highest bid to maintain competitive queue position.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $84.46, maintaining a slight lead over the highest bids at $84.45, while asks remained steady near $96.13, and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of $84.52, slightly above the highest existing bid of $84.51, to maintain competitive queue positioning amid stable asks around $96.12-$96.72 and no trades yet.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $84.52, maintaining a slight lead over closest competitors at $84.5. The ask queue remains stable around $96.11-$96.72 with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, the bid queue remained clustered with my bid at $84.52 just above several buyers, while ask prices stayed stable near $96.11-$96.72; no trades occurred this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered around $84.5; ask prices persist near $96.11-$96.72; no trades so far, indicating wide spread and seller resistance. #### Thoughts: Maintaining top bid position preserves margin but no trade progress; sellers remain firm on ask prices; buyers do not increase bids aggressively. #### Updated Strategy: Continue holding bid at $84.52 to keep competitive position without sacrificing margin; closely watch for any ask price changes or buyer bid escalations; prepare for more aggressive bidding or bid withdrawal if no progress by Hour #13.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at $84.5 level with no trades; ask prices persist around $96.11 to $97.96; sellers remain firm and buyers cautiously escalate bids.
#### Thoughts: Consistent bid preserves margin but does not induce trades; sellers show no sign of lowering asks; buyers slowly increase bids but no breakthrough.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bid at $84.52 to maintain competitive position without surrendering margin this hour; prepare to reassess bid aggressiveness or withdraw if no trades by Hour #15; closely monitor any shifts in ask prices or bid escalations; balance urgency to secure trades with profitability as time runs out.

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a stable bid at $84.52 for several hours, no trades have occurred due to a persistent large spread between bids (~$84.5) and asks (~$96.1+). This conservative approach preserved margin but failed to induce transactions. Waiting too long to increase bid price has resulted in no realized profit, highlighting the need to balance competitiveness and profitability more dynamically as the deadline approaches.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I will increase my bid to $85.6, matching the highest current bid to maximize chances of trade execution. Although this reduces the profit margin, securing a trade now is critical given no prior success. This bid balances improved competitiveness with a controlled concession below true value ($100).",
  "bid": 85.6,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I placed a bid at $85.60, matching the highest current bid to improve my competitive position and attempt to secure a trade before the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue is tightly clustered between $84.3 and $85.6; no trades occurred despite stable bids and asks; ask prices remain high near $96.1-$97.96; sellers are firm and buyers gradually increase bids. #### Thoughts: Persistent large spread inhibits trades; maintaining $84.52 bid was too conservative given no prior trades; urgency increases with final hour approaching. #### Updated Strategy: Final hour requires more aggressive bid to secure trade; raise bid to $85.6 to match highest bid and improve queue position; accept lower margin to prioritize trade execution; monitor any last-minute changes but prioritize closing a deal over margin maximization."
