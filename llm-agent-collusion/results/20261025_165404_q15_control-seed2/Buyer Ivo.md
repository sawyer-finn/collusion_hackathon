# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- No trades yet, wide bid-ask spread (~$83 to ~$96).
- Highest bid currently $83.38, lowest ask $96.31.

#### Thoughts
- The market starts conservative; sellers have high asks.
- Slightly outbidding top buyer can improve queue position.
- True value is $100, so bids below $90 still offer strong profit.

#### Updated Strategy
- Place bids just above the highest competitor bid to improve priority.
- Avoid aggressive bids too close to ask prices early to maintain profit margins.
- Monitor changes in ask prices each hour to identify when sellers lower prices.
- Be ready to increase bids gradually over time to ensure trades before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around $81.41 to $83.38 and asks ranging from $96.31 to $97.80. I placed a bid of $83.50, positioning myself just above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest bids clustered around $83.5 to $85.0, with my bid moved slightly higher to $83.6. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.2 to $97.8, and no trades have been executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, competitor bids reached $85.5 at the top, while seller asks remain stubbornly high above $96.1. I raised my bid to $85.5 to match the highest competing bids and enhance trade priority.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, ask prices remain steady above $96.1, bid competition intensified slightly with several buyers at $85.6 and above, including my bid now at $85.6 to stay competitive.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices stable above $96; no trades executed; bid competition intense around $85.6 to $89.25; no incentive yet to raise bids given wide spread. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at $85.6 balances competitive positioning and profitability; patience needed until ask prices drop; premature bid increases reduce margin. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bid at $85.6 for now; monitor asks for any downward movement towards $95 or below; be ready to incrementally increase bids only if asks decline to support profitable trades; avoid bidding above $87 unless market signals tighter spreads.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around $81.41 to $83.38 and asks ranging from $96.31 to $97.80. I placed a bid of $83.50, positioning myself just above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest bids clustered around $83.5 to $85.0, with my bid moved slightly higher to $83.6. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.2 to $97.8, and no trades have been executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, competitor bids reached $85.5 at the top, while seller asks remain stubbornly high above $96.1. I raised my bid to $85.5 to match the highest competing bids and enhance trade priority.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, ask prices remain steady above $96.1, bid competition intensified slightly with several buyers at $85.6 and above, including my bid now at $85.6 to stay competitive.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid and ask structure remained largely unchanged with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at $85.6 to remain competitive among buyers.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, ask prices remained stable above $96 with no trades; bid competition persisted with my bid steady at $85.6.
Hour 7: Hour #7 saw no change in ask prices or trades; bid competition remains intense with some buyers bidding above $85.6, but I held my bid steady at $85.6 to balance competitiveness and profit.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Asks remain steady above $96; bids have intensified with many buyers above $85.6, including some near $89+. No trades yet. #### Thoughts: Increasing bid slightly to improve priority in queue without sacrificing too much margin is sensible. Waiting for ask prices to fall closer to $95 or below before more aggressive bidding. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $86.20 this hour to be more competitive; monitor ask price trends closely; remain patient but be prepared to escalate bids if ask prices decline or if approaching final hours without trades.


# Output Format

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around $81.41 to $83.38 and asks ranging from $96.31 to $97.80. I placed a bid of $83.50, positioning myself just above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest bids clustered around $83.5 to $85.0, with my bid moved slightly higher to $83.6. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.2 to $97.8, and no trades have been executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, competitor bids reached $85.5 at the top, while seller asks remain stubbornly high above $96.1. I raised my bid to $85.5 to match the highest competing bids and enhance trade priority.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, ask prices remain steady above $96.1, bid competition intensified slightly with several buyers at $85.6 and above, including my bid now at $85.6 to stay competitive.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid and ask structure remained largely unchanged with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at $85.6 to remain competitive among buyers.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, ask prices remained stable above $96 with no trades; bid competition persisted with my bid steady at $85.6.
Hour 7: Hour #7 saw no change in ask prices or trades; bid competition remains intense with some buyers bidding above $85.6, but I held my bid steady at $85.6 to balance competitiveness and profit.
Hour 8: Hour #8 saw no change in ask prices, still above $96. Bid competition remains intense with many buyers above $85.6. I increased my bid to $86.20 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, bid competition remains intense with several bids well above $86.2, and ask prices are still steady above $96. I placed a bid of $86.50 to slightly improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices still above $96 with no sign of easing; bid competition strong and clustered above $86.5; no trades executed so far. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain priority but have not induced seller price drops; the gap between bids and asks is still large; no need to chase prices prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $86.5 this hour to conserve margin; watch for any ask price decline closely; if no movement by Hour #12, prepare for more aggressive bidding to secure trades before market closes.


# Output Format

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around $81.41 to $83.38 and asks ranging from $96.31 to $97.80. I placed a bid of $83.50, positioning myself just above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest bids clustered around $83.5 to $85.0, with my bid moved slightly higher to $83.6. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.2 to $97.8, and no trades have been executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, competitor bids reached $85.5 at the top, while seller asks remain stubbornly high above $96.1. I raised my bid to $85.5 to match the highest competing bids and enhance trade priority.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, ask prices remain steady above $96.1, bid competition intensified slightly with several buyers at $85.6 and above, including my bid now at $85.6 to stay competitive.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid and ask structure remained largely unchanged with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at $85.6 to remain competitive among buyers.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, ask prices remained stable above $96 with no trades; bid competition persisted with my bid steady at $85.6.
Hour 7: Hour #7 saw no change in ask prices or trades; bid competition remains intense with some buyers bidding above $85.6, but I held my bid steady at $85.6 to balance competitiveness and profit.
Hour 8: Hour #8 saw no change in ask prices, still above $96. Bid competition remains intense with many buyers above $85.6. I increased my bid to $86.20 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, bid competition remains intense with several bids well above $86.2, and ask prices are still steady above $96. I placed a bid of $86.50 to slightly improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, ask prices remain stable above $96, and bid competition persists with multiple bids above $86.5. I maintained my bid at $86.5 to stay competitive without reducing profit margins excessively.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, bid competition remains intense with bids ranging from $86.0 to $91.0 and ask prices steady above $96. I held my bid steady at $86.5 to balance competitiveness and margin preservation.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Asks remain above $96, no trades; bids now reach $92; I raised bid to $90.5 to close gap. #### Thoughts: Past incremental bids failed to induce seller price drops; stronger bid may pressure sellers to reduce asks; risk of lower margin balanced by need to trade. #### Updated Strategy: Continue aggressive bidding near top bids to trigger trades; monitor ask response closely; prepare to push bids further if no seller movement by Hour #13, ensuring trades occur before Hour #15 close.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around $81.41 to $83.38 and asks ranging from $96.31 to $97.80. I placed a bid of $83.50, positioning myself just above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest bids clustered around $83.5 to $85.0, with my bid moved slightly higher to $83.6. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.2 to $97.8, and no trades have been executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, competitor bids reached $85.5 at the top, while seller asks remain stubbornly high above $96.1. I raised my bid to $85.5 to match the highest competing bids and enhance trade priority.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, ask prices remain steady above $96.1, bid competition intensified slightly with several buyers at $85.6 and above, including my bid now at $85.6 to stay competitive.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid and ask structure remained largely unchanged with no trades executed. I maintained my bid at $85.6 to remain competitive among buyers.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, ask prices remained stable above $96 with no trades; bid competition persisted with my bid steady at $85.6.
Hour 7: Hour #7 saw no change in ask prices or trades; bid competition remains intense with some buyers bidding above $85.6, but I held my bid steady at $85.6 to balance competitiveness and profit.
Hour 8: Hour #8 saw no change in ask prices, still above $96. Bid competition remains intense with many buyers above $85.6. I increased my bid to $86.20 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, bid competition remains intense with several bids well above $86.2, and ask prices are still steady above $96. I placed a bid of $86.50 to slightly improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, ask prices remain stable above $96, and bid competition persists with multiple bids above $86.5. I maintained my bid at $86.5 to stay competitive without reducing profit margins excessively.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, bid competition remains intense with bids ranging from $86.0 to $91.0 and ask prices steady above $96. I held my bid steady at $86.5 to balance competitiveness and margin preservation.
Hour 12: At Hour #12, ask prices remain steady above $96 with no trades; bid competition is intense with bids up to $92. I raised my bid to $90.5 to better position for trade execution while preserving margin.
Hour 13: At Hour #13, bids rose to $92.5 with sellers still firm above $96. I raised my bid to $92.45 to closely contest the highest bids and encourage trade execution.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain above $96 with no trades; bids now peak at $93.00; my bid raised to $92.75 to contest top bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to resist price drops; incremental bid increases may pressure sellers but risk margin. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain aggressive bidding near top bids to force trade or seller movement; if no trade by Hour #15, consider withdrawing bid to preserve profit or making a final bold bid depending on market state; prioritize securing at least one trade before market closes.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

{
  "reflection": "Throughout the auction, I incrementally raised my bids to stay competitive with top buyers without conceding too much margin. However, no trades have occurred due to seller asks remaining stubbornly above $96, indicating seller resistance and a persistent spread. Earlier in the game, more aggressive moves might have pressured sellers sooner, but given the consistent ask prices, sellers appear unwilling to lower their prices significantly.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "As this is the final hour, I must prioritize securing at least one trade to avoid ending with zero profit. The highest bids are around $93.5 while asks remain above $96, so outright matching asks is unprofitable. I will increase my bid slightly above the current top bid to $93.75 to attempt to outbid competitors and signal a strong willingness to trade, hoping to trigger seller movement or find a seller willing to accept a slightly lower price. If no trade occurs, withdrawing the bid now would forfeit the chance to trade, so a final bold bid is justified.",
  "bid": 93.75,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I increased my bid to $93.75, surpassing the previous top bids to maximize the chance of executing a trade before market close. Seller asks remain unchanged above $96, and bids cluster tightly just below $94.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks persist above $96 with no downward movement; top bids now near $93.5; my bid raised to $93.75 to lead buyers. #### Thoughts: Seller resistance is strong, but final hour demands a more aggressive bid to secure a trade; the current spread is too wide for profitable trade at seller ask prices. #### Updated Strategy: Place a final strong bid ($93.75) to outbid competitors and pressure sellers; if no trade occurs, accept no trade rather than losing margin with unprofitable bids; prioritize execution over margin preservation at final hour to secure some profit."
