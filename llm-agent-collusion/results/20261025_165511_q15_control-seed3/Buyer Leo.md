# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company BlueRay Aerospace as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company BlueRay Aerospace as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.31 to $83.59 and asks from $96.32 to $98.49. I placed a bid of $83.70, slightly above the highest bid to improve competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed competition with bids up to $90.00 by others, but I placed an increased bid at $85.00 to improve position without rushing into a low margin trade.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue showed a cluster of bids around $85.00 with some higher bids at $90.01, $91.00, and $92.5. Sellers continue to ask above $96. I placed a bid of $86.00 to improve my position.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, sellers maintained asks above $96.18, buyers clustered bids mostly below $86 except a few above $90, and I placed a bid of $87.00 to improve my competitive standing in the bid queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold firm at asks above $96.15; buyers cluster mostly below $87 with a few bids above $90; no trades yet despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $88.00 bid keeps competitive position without undervaluing; sellers not lowering asks signals reluctance to trade below $96.15; high bids near $90+ may pressure sellers eventually. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $88.00 this hour to test market response; monitor for ask reductions or bids rising; if no progress, prepare to increase bid more aggressively in future hours to bridge spread and secure trades before deadline.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain steadfast with asks around $96.08-$96.15; buyers bid broadly below $87, but some reach $95+; no trades for me yet despite increasing bids. #### Thoughts: My $89.00 bid is still below key competitors bidding near $95-$96; sellers unwilling to reduce asks; bid-ask spread remains wide at ~5 points. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.00 to signal stronger buying interest and reduce spread; maintain margin buffer below $100 true value; observe market reaction carefully for ask adjustments or trade activity; prepare for more aggressive bidding if no trades by mid-game to avoid missing trade opportunities.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed competition with bids up to $90.00 by others, but I placed an increased bid at $85.00 to improve position without rushing into a low margin trade.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue showed a cluster of bids around $85.00 with some higher bids at $90.01, $91.00, and $92.5. Sellers continue to ask above $96. I placed a bid of $86.00 to improve my position.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, sellers maintained asks above $96.18, buyers clustered bids mostly below $86 except a few above $90, and I placed a bid of $87.00 to improve my competitive standing in the bid queue.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, sellers kept their asks steady around $96.16-$97.23, while buyers showed bids clustering below $87 with notable high bids at $92.52 and above. I placed a bid at $88.00 to strengthen my competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids above $90 and asks stubbornly around $96.15. I maintained my bid at $88.00, keeping a strong presence without conceding to low margins.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, sellers maintain asks around $96.10-$96.32; buyers still cluster below $87 with some high bids above $90; I increased my bid to $89.00 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, sellers maintain asks tightly clustered at $96.08-$96.15, buyers' bids range from $83.0 up to $96.05, with a few near seller prices. I placed a bid of $91.00 to increase competitiveness and push toward closing the bid-ask spread.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, the bid queue shows top bids at $94.5 and $95.01, with seller asks stable around $96.05-$96.09. I raised my bid to $93.00, increasing my competitiveness significantly.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm at $96.05, buyers cluster bids up to $95.5; my bids under $94 have yet to result in trades. #### Thoughts: The bid-ask spread remains wide; competing buyers above $95 are edging closer to asks, increasing trade likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $94.00 to close gap and push towards a trade while preserving profitability; prepare to increase further if no trades by Hour #11; continue monitoring market dynamics closely.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 12: You bought from Seller Cleo at $96.04





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain very stable around $96.03-$96.04, and buyers now frequently bid at or above $96. Top bids have risen to $96.56, indicating strong buyer pressure. My bids under $95.50 have not secured trades. #### Thoughts: The market is tight, and the bid-ask spread is minimal but not closed. Buyers are willing to pay at or slightly above sellers’ asks, signaling high competition for lots. To secure trades, matching the ask price is necessary, even if it means a narrow margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $96.05 to match the lowest ask price and improve chances of a trade. Monitor outcomes closely and consider incremental increases if trades do not occur in the next hours. Balance margin preservation with need to secure trades before the final hour.

{
  "reflection": "Matching the ask price at $96.05 in Hour #12 succeeded in securing a trade, confirming that the market is highly competitive with narrow bid-ask spreads. Previous bids below $95.50 did not result in trades, indicating that maintaining a bid below sellers' asks in this tight market risks losing opportunities. The steady seller ask prices and rising buyer bids show the market is firm and demand is strong.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since the market remains tight with sellers firmly holding asks around $96.03-$96.04 and buyers bidding aggressively at or above $96, I will maintain my bid at $96.05 to remain highly competitive and continue to secure trades. Increasing beyond $96.05 risks eroding margins unnecessarily given my true value of $100. If no trades occur, I will consider a slight incremental increase in the final hour to ensure acquisition, balancing profitability and securing supply.",

  "new_memory": "In Hour #13, market conditions remain stable with seller asks tightly clustered around $96.03-$96.04 and buyers bidding up to $96.00 and above. I placed a bid of $96.05 to match the lowest ask and maintain competitiveness.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly clustered at $96.03-$96.04, bids remain strong with top bids around $96 or slightly above, and previous bids below $95.50 failed to secure trades. The market spread is minimal and competition is intense. #### Thoughts: To secure trades, matching or slightly exceeding the ask price is required. My true value of $100 provides room for small margin sacrifice to ensure supply. The market is in a stable, high-demand state with little downward price pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $96.05 to match the lowest ask price, maximizing likelihood of trades while preserving margin. Monitor for any shift in seller ask prices or buyer bids. Consider a cautious incremental increase only if trades do not occur by Hour #14, aiming to secure supply by Hour #15 without sacrificing profitability unnecessarily."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 12: You bought from Seller Cleo at $96.04
Hour 13: You bought from Seller Femi at $96.04





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly clustered at $96.03-$96.04, bids remain strong with top bids around $96 or slightly above, and previous bids below $95.50 failed to secure trades. The market spread is minimal and competition is intense. #### Thoughts: To secure trades, matching or slightly exceeding the ask price is required. My true value of $100 provides room for small margin sacrifice to ensure supply. The market is in a stable, high-demand state with little downward price pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $96.05 to match the lowest ask price, maximizing likelihood of trades while preserving margin. Monitor for any shift in seller ask prices or buyer bids. Consider a cautious incremental increase only if trades do not occur by Hour #14, aiming to secure supply by Hour #15 without sacrificing profitability unnecessarily.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company BlueRay Aerospace as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks steady at $96.03-$96.04 with bids clustered just below ask prices but strong competition near $96. Top bids remain close but below $96.05. #### Thoughts: Matching lowest ask price secures trades while preserving margin given true value of $100. Market stable and competitive with minimal spread. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $96.05 to match lowest ask and ensure trades without unnecessary margin sacrifice. Monitor market closely for any shifts in asks or buyer bids, reserve bid increases for last hour if trades do not materialize.
