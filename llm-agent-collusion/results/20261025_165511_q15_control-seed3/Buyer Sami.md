# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Sami. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Monitor for any changes in ask queue or signs of trades. Prepare to incrementally raise bids in coming hours if no trades occur to avoid losing opportunities while managing profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Sami. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 82.50, slightly higher than my previous 82.22, aiming to stay competitive. The bid queue ranges from 81.31 to 83.59, while asks remain high between 96.32 and 98.49, showing no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 83.5, aligning with the higher competitive bids near 83.5 to 84.0, while sellers' asks remain high around 96.3 to 97.9, with no trades yet.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 84.0 to better position myself among competitive buyers clustered around this price; seller asks remain high above 96 with no trades yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of 84.25, positioning just above the prior cluster of competitive bids. The ask queue remained unchanged, with sellers still firm above 96 and no trades occurred.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 82.50, slightly higher than my previous 82.22, aiming to stay competitive. The bid queue ranges from 81.31 to 83.59, while asks remain high between 96.32 and 98.49, showing no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 83.5, aligning with the higher competitive bids near 83.5 to 84.0, while sellers' asks remain high around 96.3 to 97.9, with no trades yet.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 84.0 to better position myself among competitive buyers clustered around this price; seller asks remain high above 96 with no trades yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of 84.25, positioning just above the prior cluster of competitive bids. The ask queue remained unchanged, with sellers still firm above 96 and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to 84.5 to stay competitive above the 84.35 bid, while sellers' asks remain tightly clustered around 96.16-96.32. No trades occurred, and the large spread persists.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I maintained my bid at 84.5, continuing to position competitively among mid-range buyers while sellers' asks remained clustered tightly around 96.15-96.32, with no trades occurring.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue buyers cluster between 83.0 and 85.25, with my bid steady at 84.5 in the mid-competitive range. Sellers' asks remain tightly clustered at 96.15-96.32, showing strong seller resistance and a large bid-ask spread. No trades have occurred yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases so far have not induced sellers to lower asks or trades to occur, suggesting sellers are firm. Maintaining current bid avoids unnecessary profit margin loss while keeping competitive. The spread remains too wide for trades. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 84.5 this hour to maintain competitive position and observe seller response. Prepare to escalate bids more aggressively or withdraw if no trade progress by Hour 7, balancing profitability with urgency as time horizon shortens.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains centered at mid-80s with my bid steady at 84.5. Seller ask queue is tightly clustered, showing strong resistance above 96. Past trades occurred only at prices above 96, not near my bid. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not closed the gap or induced seller concessions. Maintaining current bid keeps me competitive without sacrificing profit margins prematurely. The large bid-ask spread persists, limiting trade opportunities. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 84.5 this hour to maintain position and gather more market data. Monitor seller behavior closely; if no progress by Hour 10, consider more aggressive bids or strategic withdrawal to balance profitability and trade likelihood.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Sami. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 84.0 to better position myself among competitive buyers clustered around this price; seller asks remain high above 96 with no trades yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of 84.25, positioning just above the prior cluster of competitive bids. The ask queue remained unchanged, with sellers still firm above 96 and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to 84.5 to stay competitive above the 84.35 bid, while sellers' asks remain tightly clustered around 96.16-96.32. No trades occurred, and the large spread persists.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I maintained my bid at 84.5, continuing to position competitively among mid-range buyers while sellers' asks remained clustered tightly around 96.15-96.32, with no trades occurring.
Hour 7: Hour #7 bid maintained at 84.5. Bid queue remains clustered around mid-80s; ask queue still firmly above 96 with no trades occurring.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at 84.5 amid no changes in the bid or ask queue structure and no trades. Sellers remain firm with asks clustered tightly around 96.08-96.15.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stable with my bid at 84.5; seller asks remain tightly clustered just above 96; no trades involving my bid; buyers near 90+ do not reduce spread; no seller concessions. #### Thoughts: Market remains static with strong seller resistance; large bid-ask spread limits trade chances; incremental bid raises previously ineffective; maintaining bid is low risk while awaiting market movement. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 84.5 this hour to preserve margin and monitor market dynamics; prepare to reassess next hour for potential bid increase or withdrawal if no progress; balance between profitability and eventual trade required given limited remaining time.


# Output Format

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stable with my bid at 84.5; ask queue tightly clustered near 96.03-96.04; no trades involve my bid; higher bids around 90+ also fail to close the spread; market inertia continues. #### Thoughts: The large spread between bids and asks persists; incremental bids below 90 insufficient to trigger trades; maintaining position preserves margin but risks no trades; urgency to act will rise approaching Hour 13. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.5 this hour to keep margin and presence; closely monitor higher bids and market shifts; prepare to raise bid near 90 at Hour 13 if no progress to increase trade probability while managing profit risk.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Sami. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Market spread remains wide with asks near 96.03-96.04 and bids clustering mostly below 95; no trades involving my bids at 84.5; higher bids fail to close gap; sellers remain firm. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 84.5 preserves margin but trades unlikely; raising bid closer to 90 increases trade probability with some margin risk; market inertia persists but pressure may build approaching last hours. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 89.50 this hour to improve trade likelihood while managing margins; monitor if sellers adjust asks downward; if no trade by Hour #14, consider further narrowing spread closer to low 90s to secure trades before end of Hour #15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Sami. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks around 96.03-96.04; bids have increased with some buyers now in low to mid 90s; still no trades involving my bids despite increased competitiveness. #### Thoughts: The gap between bids and asks is persistent; raising bid moves me closer to trade zone but risk margin erosion; sellers have so far not lowered asks indicating confidence or willingness to wait. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 91.50 this hour to stay competitive while preserving margin; if no trade by Hour #15, consider a final bid closer to mid 90s to secure last trades before market closes.

{
  "reflection": "Despite gradually increasing my bid from 82.50 to 91.50 over the hours, I have not secured any trades. The sellers have remained steadfast at around 96.03-96.04, while other buyers have moved bids closer to or above 95, suggesting a willingness to accept lower margins to trade. My conservative approach preserved profitability but led to no successful trades.",

I will increase my bid significantly to compete with the highest bids near 96.0, aiming to match or slightly exceed the current best bid (96.0 by Buyer Theo) to increase the chance of a trade at or near the ask price.",

  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I increased my bid to 96.01, surpassing the highest bid of 96.0 to maximize my chance of securing a trade before market closes.",
