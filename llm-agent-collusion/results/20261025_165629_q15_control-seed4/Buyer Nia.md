# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.27 to $83.64 and asks from $96.27 upward. I placed a bid of $83.65, just above the highest existing bid, to establish a competitive position early on.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue shifted slightly with my bid now at $84.25, just above the previous highest bid of $84.0. The ask queue remains high with no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, I increased my bid to $86.25, positioning just above the highest bid of $86.0 to test seller response amid still high asks around $96-$98.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I increased my bid to $86.5, stepping just above the highest current bid of $86.5 held by others to maintain a strong position. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.15 to $98.68, with no trades executed yet.

Hour 3: At Hour #3, I increased my bid to $86.25, positioning just above the highest bid of $86.0 to test seller response amid still high asks around $96-$98.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I increased my bid to $86.5, stepping just above the highest current bid of $86.5 held by others to maintain a strong position. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.15 to $98.68, with no trades executed yet.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.50 to $87.00 with my bid steady at $86.50; asks remain stubbornly high around $96.14 to $98.68, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with several buyers clustered around $86.50 to $87.25. Seller asks still high near $96-$98. I placed a bid of $87.00 to improve position slightly above some bids but below the highest $88.00 bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller ask prices remain stubbornly high around $96-$99 with no trades despite strong buyer bids near $86.50-$87.25. Buyer bids are fairly clustered but no one is crossing sellers. #### Thoughts: The persistent wide spread indicates seller confidence and buyer caution; incremental bid increases are necessary to test seller price flexibility without sacrificing too much margin early. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $87.00 this hour to slightly outbid some buyers and signal willingness to trade. Monitor seller response closely; if no trades occur soon, consider further gradual bid increases approaching $88.00 while preserving margin for final hours.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks stubbornly high near $96-$99 while buyer bids cluster at $87.50-$88.75; no trades executed thus far. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not induced seller ask reductions or trades; buyers aggressively compete but gap remains large. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $87.50 this hour to gauge seller response and buyer competition; prepare to increase bid towards $88 next hour if no trades occur, aiming to balance margin preservation and trade likelihood given limited time horizon.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.27 to $83.64 and asks from $96.27 upward. I placed a bid of $83.65, just above the highest existing bid, to establish a competitive position early on.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue shifted slightly with my bid now at $84.25, just above the previous highest bid of $84.0. The ask queue remains high with no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, I increased my bid to $86.25, positioning just above the highest bid of $86.0 to test seller response amid still high asks around $96-$98.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I increased my bid to $86.5, stepping just above the highest current bid of $86.5 held by others to maintain a strong position. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.15 to $98.68, with no trades executed yet.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.50 to $87.00 with my bid steady at $86.50; asks remain stubbornly high around $96.14 to $98.68, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with several buyers clustered around $86.50 to $87.25. Seller asks still high near $96-$98. I placed a bid of $87.00 to improve position slightly above some bids but below the highest $88.00 bid.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I increased my bid to $87.50 matching the top buyer bids to strengthen my position. Seller asks remain high around $96.11 to $98.68 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $87.50, matching the top bids. Seller asks remain high at $96.10 and above, with no trades occurring yet.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I maintained my bid at $87.50, matching several top buyers. Seller asks remain stubbornly high near $96.09 to $97.90, and no trades executed again.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks continue to hold firm near $96-$98; buyer bids cluster from $86.0 to $90.0, with no trades despite aggressive bidding. Last hour's steady bid at $87.5 was insufficient to move sellers or execute trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases need to be more assertive to narrow the gap and induce seller response. Sellers show no indication of lowering asks under current bid levels. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $88.00 this hour to test seller flexibility and buyer competition limits. Monitor closely for any trade signals; if no trades by Hour #12, consider more aggressive bids closer to $89-$90 to secure trades before market close, balancing margin and certainty.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.27 to $83.64 and asks from $96.27 upward. I placed a bid of $83.65, just above the highest existing bid, to establish a competitive position early on.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue shifted slightly with my bid now at $84.25, just above the previous highest bid of $84.0. The ask queue remains high with no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, I increased my bid to $86.25, positioning just above the highest bid of $86.0 to test seller response amid still high asks around $96-$98.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I increased my bid to $86.5, stepping just above the highest current bid of $86.5 held by others to maintain a strong position. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.15 to $98.68, with no trades executed yet.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.50 to $87.00 with my bid steady at $86.50; asks remain stubbornly high around $96.14 to $98.68, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with several buyers clustered around $86.50 to $87.25. Seller asks still high near $96-$98. I placed a bid of $87.00 to improve position slightly above some bids but below the highest $88.00 bid.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I increased my bid to $87.50 matching the top buyer bids to strengthen my position. Seller asks remain high around $96.11 to $98.68 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $87.50, matching the top bids. Seller asks remain high at $96.10 and above, with no trades occurring yet.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I maintained my bid at $87.50, matching several top buyers. Seller asks remain stubbornly high near $96.09 to $97.90, and no trades executed again.
Hour 10: Placed a bid of $88.00 to improve position slightly above previous $87.5 bids. Market remains unchanged with seller asks stubbornly high around $96.09 to $97.8 and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 11: Placed a bid of $88.50, matching the highest existing bids in the buyer queue; seller asks remain high near $96.05 to $97.7 with no trades executed this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persist near $96-$98, buyers cluster $86-$89.5; no trades despite incremental bid rises. Sellers show strong price resistance.
#### Thoughts: Previous incremental bid raises maintained buyer queue position but failed to close gap or induce seller concessions. Market shows segmentation with sellers holding firm and buyers capped around $89. 
#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid more decisively to $89.00 to signal stronger intent and test seller flexibility. Prepare to escalate bids further toward $90+ in next hours if no trades occur to balance profit with trade certainty before market closes.

Hour 3: At Hour #3, I increased my bid to $86.25, positioning just above the highest bid of $86.0 to test seller response amid still high asks around $96-$98.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I increased my bid to $86.5, stepping just above the highest current bid of $86.5 held by others to maintain a strong position. The ask prices remain high, ranging from $96.15 to $98.68, with no trades executed yet.

Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with several buyers clustered around $86.50 to $87.25. Seller asks still high near $96-$98. I placed a bid of $87.00 to improve position slightly above some bids but below the highest $88.00 bid.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I increased my bid to $87.50 matching the top buyer bids to strengthen my position. Seller asks remain high around $96.11 to $98.68 with no trades executed yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm around $96 while buyers cluster $86-$90; no trades despite bid escalations. Sellers remain inflexible. #### Thoughts: Incremental bids maintain queue position but do not close spread; sellers unyielding. Need to push beyond $90 to signal higher willingness to pay and prompt trade. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $90.25 to test seller limits and move closer to true value; prepare to further increase bid in final hour if no trade occurs, balancing profit and certainty.

{
  "reflection": "Despite gradually increasing bids over the trading hours, no trades were secured due to the persistent ask prices significantly above $96. The incremental bid increases maintained competitive positioning but failed to incentivize sellers to lower their asks or close the bid-ask spread. Earlier hesitation to push bids closer to true value likely missed opportunities for trade in the final hours.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will increase my bid to $92.0 to demonstrate strong buying intent near the upper range of bids and closer to the true value of $100. This bid aims to maximize chances of trade execution while balancing profit margin, as no trades have occurred yet and sellers have remained inflexible.",
  "bid": 92.0,
  "new_memory": "At Hour #15, I placed a bid of $92.00, moving significantly above prior bids to push for a trade before market close. Seller asks remain around $95.75 to $96.03, still well above bids, with no trades reported yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller ask prices remain steady and high near $96+, while buyer bids cluster below $90 until recent increments; no trades executed. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no willingness to lower asks; bids must approach true value to secure trades. Incremental bid increases insufficient to close bid-ask gap. #### Updated Strategy: As the last hour, place a strong bid at $92.00 to signal maximum willingness to pay and increase likelihood of closing a trade, balancing profit and certainty of execution."
