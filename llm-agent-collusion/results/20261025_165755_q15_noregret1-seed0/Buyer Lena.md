# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of 85.00 to increase competitiveness and gauge seller response, while still maintaining room for profit given asks are near 97.6 and above.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of 86.00, slightly higher than last hour to probe seller price flexibility. Sellers' lowest asks remain above 96.3, and no trades with my bid have occurred yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 88.00 this hour to attempt better market competitiveness as asks remain high near 96.3 and above. No trades occurred yet involving my bid.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $90.00 this hour to aggressively narrow the bid-ask spread and test seller willingness to transact below $92.49. Observed buyers mostly bidding under $86.25 and sellers holding firm above $96.3 except the low ask at $92.49.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Tara at $87.75





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers consistently hold asks above $96.23, buyers mostly bid below $87.00 except my $90.00. Spread remains wide and no trades triggered by my bid. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yielding; my $90.00 bid keeps me top bidder but no trade evidence suggests sellers unwilling to lower prices. Bid withdrawal now might reduce market presence prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $90.00 bid to test further seller reaction this hour. If no trade or ask drop by Hour 7, consider bid withdrawal or strategic re-entry below $90.00 to balance profitability and competitiveness.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Tara at $87.75





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers consistently hold asks above $96.21; my $90.00 bid remains the highest but has not triggered trades; market shows strong seller resistance; other buyers bid below my level.
#### Thoughts: Maintaining $90.00 keeps me competitive without sacrificing profit margin; withdrawing risks losing market presence; sellers unlikely to drop below $96 soon; trade likelihood low at current prices.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $90.00 to maintain top buyer position; monitor for ask price declines or triggered trades; if no improvement by Hour 10, consider strategic bid adjustments closer to $92-$94 to incrementally capture trades while preserving reasonable margins.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of 85.00 to increase competitiveness and gauge seller response, while still maintaining room for profit given asks are near 97.6 and above.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of 86.00, slightly higher than last hour to probe seller price flexibility. Sellers' lowest asks remain above 96.3, and no trades with my bid have occurred yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 88.00 this hour to attempt better market competitiveness as asks remain high near 96.3 and above. No trades occurred yet involving my bid.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $90.00 this hour to aggressively narrow the bid-ask spread and test seller willingness to transact below $92.49. Observed buyers mostly bidding under $86.25 and sellers holding firm above $96.3 except the low ask at $92.49.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of $90.00 this hour, maintaining aggressive positioning to test seller price flexibility. Observed that seller asks remain clustered above $96.24 with no immediate trade triggered by this bid.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $90.00 and remain the highest bidder. Sellers hold firm with asks above $96.23, and no trades occurred involving my bid this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $90.00 again this hour. Sellers continued to hold asks above $96.22, and no trades involved my bid during Hour 7.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $90.00 again. Sellers maintained asks above $96.21 with no trades involving my bid, and I remain the highest bidder at $90.00.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $90.00 again. Sellers continue to hold asks above $96.20, and I remain the highest bidder with no trades involving my bid this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Tara at $87.75





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold firm with asks above $96.19; my $90.00 bid remains the highest but no trades triggered; other buyers bid below me; sellers show strong price resistance.
#### Thoughts: Maintaining $90.00 preserves top bid spot and profit margin; sellers unlikely to drop below $96 soon; withdrawing or lowering bid risks losing market presence.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $90.00 this hour to maintain highest buyer position; monitor ask trends and trade activity; if no improvement by Hour 11, incrementally raise bid to $92-$94 to increase trade likelihood while preserving profit margin.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 5: Placed a bid of $90.00 this hour, maintaining aggressive positioning to test seller price flexibility. Observed that seller asks remain clustered above $96.24 with no immediate trade triggered by this bid.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $90.00 and remain the highest bidder. Sellers hold firm with asks above $96.23, and no trades occurred involving my bid this hour.

Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $90.00 again. Sellers continue to hold asks above $96.20, and I remain the highest bidder with no trades involving my bid this hour.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I maintained my bid at $90.00 as the highest bid; seller asks persisted above $96.19 and no trades were triggered involving my bid.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $90.00, remaining the highest bidder. Sellers' lowest asks persist above $96.18, and no trades involved my bid this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Tara at $87.75





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with lowest asks above $96.17; my $90.00 bid continues as highest with no trades triggered; other buyers bid below or near my level but none surpassed it; bid-ask spread remains wide and stable.
#### Thoughts: Maintaining $90.00 preserves top bid status and profit margin but is insufficient to induce seller price concession; market shows strong seller resistance; incremental bid increase needed soon to improve trade chances while limiting margin erosion.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $90.00 this hour to maintain highest bid and monitor seller response; if no improvement by Hour 13, increase bid to $91.50-$92.00 to pressure sellers closer to trade zone; avoid bid increases beyond this range to protect profitability.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Tara at $87.75
Hour 13: You bought from Seller Tara at $87.5
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Tara at $88.5





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold asks above $96.15; bid-ask spread remains wide; my bid increased to $91.50 last hour moved me to the highest bidder status but no trades resulted. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases help gauge seller flexibility and push spread closer; sellers are not yet conceding below $96; maintaining bids under $92 preserves margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $92.00 this hour to strengthen buying signal and narrow spread further; monitor seller reactions closely; avoid aggressive jumps that erode margin; prepare for possible final bid adjustments in Hour 15 if no trade occurs.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases have placed me among the highest bidders but failed to trigger trades as seller asks remain significantly above my bids. The bid-ask spread remains wide, limiting trade execution, and my margins have been preserved but trading volume limited. I could have considered a slightly larger bid increment earlier to test seller limits more aggressively while still protecting profit.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With the final hour approaching and no trades at or above $91.5, I will raise my bid to $93.00 to further pressure sellers toward narrowing the spread and increase chances of making a trade before market close, balancing competitiveness with margin preservation. If no trade occurs, I will be ready to withdraw to minimize losses.",
  "bid": 93.0,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid of $93.00 this hour to increase buying competitiveness and attempt to close the persistent bid-ask spread. Seller asks remain above $96.14, with no immediate trade triggered by this bid yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain stubbornly above $96.14; bid-ask spread still wide; my gradual bid increases moved me closer to sellers but no trades at these levels yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases help test seller limits but have not closed the gap; sellers are holding firm above $96, limiting trade opportunities; preserving margin important but final hour demands more competitive bids. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $93.00 this hour to intensify price pressure on sellers while maintaining a buffer to true value; prepare for potential withdrawal if no trade materializes to avoid overpaying; closely monitor final market responses."
