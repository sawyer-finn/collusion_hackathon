# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $84.00, which is above the current highest bid of $83.7 but well below the lowest ask of $96.43. Observed a wide bid-ask spread indicating early market stage with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.25, which is above the current highest bid of $84.0 but still well below the lowest ask of $96.3. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $86.25, the highest bid in the queue now. The spread remains large as the lowest ask is still above $92.5. No new trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $86.30, slightly above the highest bid of $86.25 to maintain a competitive position. No trades occurred this hour; the lowest ask remains significantly above bids, keeping the spread wide.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highest bid now $86.45 by me; lowest ask still above $96.23, no trades again, spread remains wide. Sellers hold firm on ask prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep me competitive but no trade execution yet. Sellers are not lowering prices; market liquidity is low. Patience is key but time pressure will increase. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids slightly above highest bid to maintain top position without losing margin. Closely monitor ask queue for any sign of downward movement. Prepare to increase bid increments more aggressively in later hours to balance profitability with trade execution urgency.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: My bid is now $88.40, below the highest bid of $88.5 by Buyer Leo. The lowest ask remains around $96.21, keeping the spread wide. No trades occurred again this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases have yet to close the gap enough for trades; sellers remain firm. Buyer Leo is the main competitor above me. #### Updated Strategy: Bid just below the highest bid to challenge Buyer Leo while maintaining margin, aiming to pressure sellers to reduce asks. Continue incremental bid increases hourly, balancing profit preservation and trade execution urgency as final hours approach.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: My bid at $89.40 was just below Buyer Leo's $89.5, with no trades and sellers holding firm at $96.19 ask. The spread remains wide and no trade executed. #### Thoughts: Increasing my bid just above Leo's bid could pressure sellers and buyers alike, potentially forcing trades or narrowing the spread. Large jumps risk margin, but small increments maintain competitiveness. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $89.55 to top the bid queue, testing seller resistance while preserving profit margin. Continue incremental adjustments hourly, aiming to narrow spread gradually and secure trades before Hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 8: Placed a bid of $88.40, elevating my bid above Buyers Dev and Ravi at $87.0 but below Buyer Leo's $88.5. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of $89.40, positioning just below Buyer Leo's $89.5, aiming to compete strongly while preserving some profit margin. The ask prices remain high around $96.20, with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid of $89.55, moving just above Buyer Leo's $89.5 bid to become the highest bidder. The lowest ask remains near $96.19, and no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks above $96 and no trades despite my highest bids near $90. The bid-ask spread remains wide, discouraging trades. #### Thoughts: Maintaining highest bid with small increments helps keep position but is insufficient to close the spread. Sellers are not lowering asks. Time is running out with 3 hours left. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly again to $89.95 to maintain top position and signal readiness to pay more, but hold margin. Monitor for any ask reductions or trades. Prepare to increase bids more aggressively in last hours if spread persists.


# Output Format

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks have remained steady above $96 despite many hours and increasing bids. Buyers cluster bids around $90-$91 but no trades happen, indicating sellers' reluctance or overpricing. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not yielded trades; sellers' high asks and lack of concessions risk no acquisition before the end. Time is critical with only one hour left after this. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $90.50 this hour to demonstrate stronger intent and pressure sellers. Prepare to further increase bid aggressively in Hour 15 if no trade occurs to secure at least one lot before market closes.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

````json
{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases up to $90.50 have not resulted in trades due to sellers' consistently high asks around $96, showing a strong ask resistance. Waiting and small bid increments have not pressured sellers to lower their prices or accept trades, risking no acquisition before market close.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I must prioritize securing at least one trade to benefit the company. I will increase my bid more aggressively above the current highest bids around $91.6 to $92.00, aiming to become the highest bidder and signal strong buying intent. This may pressure sellers or trigger a trade despite the wide spread, balancing profitability with the urgency to acquire.",
  "bid": 92.0,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid of $92.00, surpassing the highest current bids near $91.6 to become the highest bidder. Sellers' asks remain unchanged above $96, and no trades occurred this hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain stubbornly high above $96, while buyers cluster bids around $90-$91 with no trades. Incremental bid increases have failed to close the gap. With only one hour left, time pressure to secure trades is critical. #### Thoughts: The wide bid-ask spread is unlikely to close without a significant bid increase signaling strong intent. Waiting further risks no acquisition. #### Updated Strategy: In this final hour, place a bid at $92.00 to exceed all other bids and maximize the chance of securing a trade, accepting a reduced profit margin to ensure acquisition."
