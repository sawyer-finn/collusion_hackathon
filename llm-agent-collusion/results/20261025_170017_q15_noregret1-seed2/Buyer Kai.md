# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of 83.50, which is slightly above the current highest bid of 83.38. Observed the bid queue and ask queue with a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of 84.01, just above current highest bid of 84.0, maintaining top bid priority. Observed no trades; ask prices still well above 96.3, indicating sellers remain firm.
Hour 3: Placed bid of 85.51, slightly above previous top bid of 85.5, maintaining top bid priority. Observed no decrease in ask prices or trades this hour.
Hour 4: Placed bid at 85.76, marginally above highest competing bid of 85.75. Observed no trades and seller asks remain above 96.01, indicating continued wide spread and seller resistance to price reduction.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top competing bid raised to 85.75; I responded with 85.76 to maintain priority. Asks remain high at 96.01+, no trades recorded this hour. Spread remains wide, indicating seller resistance.
#### Thoughts: Sellers are not budging on asks, so patience and gradual bid increases are critical to avoid eroding profit margins prematurely.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases just above highest competing bid to maintain top position and apply gradual pressure to sellers, while watching for any narrowing in ask prices or trades. Aim to balance profit protection with eventual trade execution as time horizon shortens.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top competing bid increased to 85.91; I raised to 86.01 to maintain top bid. Seller asks remain steadfast above 95.89, no trades this hour. Spread remains large and sellers are not yielding. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases have maintained priority but failed to pressure sellers; other buyers show willingness to bid higher but sellers hold firm, indicating patience on seller side. #### Updated Strategy: Continue minimal incremental increases to maintain top bid and protect margin. Watch for any drop in ask prices or trades. Prepare to escalate bids more aggressively if no progress by mid-game hours to avoid missing trade opportunities while balancing profitability.


# Output Format

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Incremental bid increases have maintained top bid just above 86.0, but no trades due to sellers’ firm asks near 95.7-96.0. Other buyers bid up to 90.5, showing willingness to pay more, but sellers remain patient. Wide spread persists. #### Thoughts: Sellers’ reservation prices exceed current bid levels, leading to no trade. Maintaining minimal increments preserves margin but does not induce sellers to lower asks. Need to balance patience with timely escalation. #### Updated Strategy: Continue minimal bid increases to hold top bid position, testing sellers’ resolve. Monitor ask prices and trades closely. Prepare to increase bid increments aggressively if no trade or ask decrease by hour 10 to secure trades while managing profit margins.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persistently high near 95+; trades occur mostly in 88-92 range by others. Competing bids now cluster around 90-90.6, leaving my previous 89.75 bid less competitive. #### Thoughts: Need to bid near highest competing bids to increase chance of matching asks and induce sellers to lower prices or agree to trades. Gradual but meaningful bid increases may pressure sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 90.50 this hour to close gap with top buyers, monitor seller response. If no trades or ask decrease by hour 11, consider further incremental increases or strategic bid withdrawals to reassess market dynamics before final hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persist around 94.2-96 with no downward movement; competing bids tightly clustered 90.6-90.7; no trades for me yet despite top bid priority. Buyer Yara continues buying from Seller Dev around mid-90s. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases insufficient to close spread or trigger trades; sellers have strong reservation prices. Must raise bid more substantially to signal intent and possibly prompt seller adjustment. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 91.00, surpassing all others, to become clear top bidder; monitor seller ask reaction; prepare to escalate further if no trade or ask reduction in next hours, balancing profitability and trade likelihood given limited remaining time.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain firm above 93.89 despite maintaining top bid at 91.5; competing bids cluster near 91.0-91.1; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no sign of lowering ask prices; maintaining bid at 91.5 preserves profit margin while signaling strong intent; risk of losing opportunity if bid too low. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 91.5 to sustain top bid status and pressure sellers; reassess next hour for potential bid increase or withdrawal depending on market movement and remaining time.


# Output Format

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

{
  "reflection": "Despite persistently placing bids to maintain top bid priority around 85-91.5, no trades have occurred due to seller ask prices remaining stubbornly above 93.49. This indicates a clear resistance from sellers to lower their asks and a significant gap between buyer willingness to pay and seller expectations. My earlier cautious increases preserved profit margin but failed to secure trades. Approaching the final hour, the strategy needed a more aggressive approach to bridge the spread.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the final hour and no trades secured, I will increase my bid to 92.5, slightly above the current highest bid of 92.0, to improve chances of matching sellers' asks or encouraging sellers to lower their asks closer to my bid. This bid balances improving trade probability with still maintaining a profit margin (below my true value of 100). If no trade occurs now, withdrawing would forfeit any opportunity, so maintaining an aggressive bid is optimal.",
  "bid": 92.5,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid at 92.5, surpassing the highest competing bid of 92.0 to maximize chances of trade as this is the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm but clustered around 93.49 to 95.59; buyers bids cluster from 90.0 to 92.0; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers unwilling to drop below ~93.5; bids below 91.5 ineffective; final hour demands aggressive bidding to secure trades while preserving profit margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 92.5 to surpass highest bid and close gap with asks; this is last chance to trade, so prioritize securing at least one trade over margin compression."
