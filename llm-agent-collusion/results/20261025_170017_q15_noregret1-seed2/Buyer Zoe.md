# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide spread between bids and asks; I placed my bid at $84.00, above the highest existing bid, positioning to close the gap with asks cautiously.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed my bid at $84.00 as the highest among buyers, but asks remained high around $96.3 to $97.8. No trades occurred. I raised my bid to $85.50 to attempt to close the gap further.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $87.00 to narrow the spread further amid persistently high sellers' asks around $96.19 to $97.8, aiming to provoke movement in ask prices or trades.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with the bid queue showing my bid at $87.00 as the highest among buyers, while asks remained clustered tightly near $96.09. I raised my bid to $88.50 to attempt closing the spread further and attract trades.

- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide spread between bids and asks; I placed my bid at $84.00, above the highest existing bid, positioning to close the gap with asks cautiously.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed my bid at $84.00 as the highest among buyers, but asks remained high around $96.3 to $97.8. No trades occurred. I raised my bid to $85.50 to attempt to close the gap further.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $87.00 to narrow the spread further amid persistently high sellers' asks around $96.19 to $97.8, aiming to provoke movement in ask prices or trades.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with the bid queue showing my bid at $87.00 as the highest among buyers, while asks remained clustered tightly near $96.09. I raised my bid to $88.50 to attempt closing the spread further and attract trades.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opened with my bid at $88.50 as the highest bid and sellers maintaining asks near $96. I raised my bid to $90.00 to pressure the ask side and encourage trades.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid at $90.00 as the highest among buyers, while sellers keep asks near $96. I maintain my bid at $90.00 to test seller response and potentially trigger trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm near $96 despite my bid increases; Buyer Yara trades above $90 indicating some market price acceptance higher than my bids. #### Thoughts: My incremental bid increases have not yet induced trades or ask reductions; holding $90.00 can sustain pressure without sacrificing margin prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $90.00 this hour to test if sellers respond or trades occur; if no trades or ask movement by next hour, consider moderate incremental increase balancing urgency and profitability.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm near $96; Buyer Yara trades consistently above $90 indicating market acceptance at higher levels; no trades on my bids so far; spread remains wide and stable. #### Thoughts: Holding $90.00 maintains pressure while preserving margin; sellers show no signs of lowering asks; Buyer Yara's activity suggests room to increase bid in future cautiously. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $90.00 this hour to test seller response and observe market. If no improvement next hour, increment bid to $90.50 to apply additional pressure while balancing profitability.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm near $94.5-$96; no trade on our bid at $90.25; buyers cluster around $89 to $90.6; Buyer Yara trades consistently above $90, indicating some market acceptance at that level. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $90.25 preserves margin and competitive position; sellers show no signs of lowering asks yet; buyer clustering suggests cautious market sentiment. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $90.25 this hour to test for seller response without losing margin; if no trade or ask reduction next hour, consider increasing bid incrementally to $90.50 to apply more pressure, balancing profitability with trade likelihood.

# Market Rules

Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed my bid at $84.00 as the highest among buyers, but asks remained high around $96.3 to $97.8. No trades occurred. I raised my bid to $85.50 to attempt to close the gap further.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $87.00 to narrow the spread further amid persistently high sellers' asks around $96.19 to $97.8, aiming to provoke movement in ask prices or trades.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with the bid queue showing my bid at $87.00 as the highest among buyers, while asks remained clustered tightly near $96.09. I raised my bid to $88.50 to attempt closing the spread further and attract trades.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opened with my bid at $88.50 as the highest bid and sellers maintaining asks near $96. I raised my bid to $90.00 to pressure the ask side and encourage trades.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid at $90.00 as the highest among buyers, while sellers keep asks near $96. I maintain my bid at $90.00 to test seller response and potentially trigger trades.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I maintained my bid at $90.00 amid stable ask prices clustered near $95.88 to $96.06. No trades involving my bid occurred, and the spread remains wide. Buyer Yara continues trading at higher prices around $92.75.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $90.00 amid stable ask prices clustered around $95.68 to $97.8, with no trades involving my bid occurring.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased my bid to $90.25, positioning just above my previous $90.00 to intensify competitive pressure without eroding too much margin.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, I maintained my bid at $90.25 amid a strong cluster of bids between $89 and $90.6 and asks still firmly near $94.5 to $96. No trades occurred against my bid.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I raised my bid to $90.50 to apply more competitive pressure, with sellers still firm in the mid-$94 range and buyers clustered below $91. No trades occurred yet against my bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm near $94.19-$96.01, buyers cluster narrowly near $90.5-$90.7, no trades against my bid at $90.50 this hour. Buyer Yara trades consistently above $90, indicating some buyers willing to pay higher prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have yet to yield trades; maintaining $90.50 balances pressure with margin protection. Further increments should be cautious and small, avoiding bids above $91 to preserve profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $90.50 this hour to test seller reaction; if no trade occurs, consider small increments around $90.60-$90.75 in subsequent hours; avoid aggressive jumps; monitor ask queue closely for downward movement.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide spread between bids and asks; I placed my bid at $84.00, above the highest existing bid, positioning to close the gap with asks cautiously.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed my bid at $84.00 as the highest among buyers, but asks remained high around $96.3 to $97.8. No trades occurred. I raised my bid to $85.50 to attempt to close the gap further.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $87.00 to narrow the spread further amid persistently high sellers' asks around $96.19 to $97.8, aiming to provoke movement in ask prices or trades.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with the bid queue showing my bid at $87.00 as the highest among buyers, while asks remained clustered tightly near $96.09. I raised my bid to $88.50 to attempt closing the spread further and attract trades.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opened with my bid at $88.50 as the highest bid and sellers maintaining asks near $96. I raised my bid to $90.00 to pressure the ask side and encourage trades.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid at $90.00 as the highest among buyers, while sellers keep asks near $96. I maintain my bid at $90.00 to test seller response and potentially trigger trades.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I maintained my bid at $90.00 amid stable ask prices clustered near $95.88 to $96.06. No trades involving my bid occurred, and the spread remains wide. Buyer Yara continues trading at higher prices around $92.75.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $90.00 amid stable ask prices clustered around $95.68 to $97.8, with no trades involving my bid occurring.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased my bid to $90.25, positioning just above my previous $90.00 to intensify competitive pressure without eroding too much margin.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, I maintained my bid at $90.25 amid a strong cluster of bids between $89 and $90.6 and asks still firmly near $94.5 to $96. No trades occurred against my bid.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I raised my bid to $90.50 to apply more competitive pressure, with sellers still firm in the mid-$94 range and buyers clustered below $91. No trades occurred yet against my bid.
Hour 12: Hour 12 opened with my bid at $90.50, the highest among buyers alongside Lia. Sellers held firm asks near $94.19 to $96.01, no trades triggered against my bid this hour.
Hour 13: Hour #13 opened with my bid at $90.50; I raised it to $90.75 to increase competitive pressure. Sellers still maintain asks near $94.09 to $95.98 with no trades triggered against my bid yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I increased my bid to $91.00, positioning above many buyers but below the top bids at $91.01 and above, with sellers still maintaining asks near $94.19 to $95.98.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold firm asks above $94 with minimal downward movement; buyers cluster narrowly below $91 with a few slightly above; Yara trades consistently above $92 indicating willingness to pay higher prices. #### Thoughts: Small bid increments have yet to trigger trades or ask price drops; maintaining bids below $91 preserves margin but limits trade chances. Increasing bids just above $91 may pressure sellers and increase trade likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.00 this hour to escalate competitive pressure without eroding profit margin excessively; if no trade occurs, consider either holding or cautiously increasing bid further in the last hour depending on market moves; watch for any downward movement in asks to capitalize on trades.

{
  "reflection": "Despite gradually increasing my bid from $84.00 to $91.00 over the past 15 hours, no trades have been secured. Sellers have maintained strong asks above $93.49, while buyers have clustered just above $90. The trade activity by Buyer Yara at prices above $92 indicates a willingness to pay more, suggesting my bid may be slightly too conservative. Incremental increases have not yet prompted ask reductions or triggered trades, highlighting a potential need for more aggressive bidding in the final hour.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will increase my bid to $91.50 to better compete with top buyers and increase the likelihood of trade execution without sacrificing too much margin. This bid also matches the current highest bids from several buyers, placing me competitively in the queue and possibly triggering trades if sellers slightly lower their asks. This strategic bid balances profitability with the necessity to secure trades before the market closes.",
  "bid": 91.5,
  "new_memory": "Hour #15 opened with sellers' asks remaining firm above $93.49 and buyers clustering at bids from $90.0 to $92.0. I increased my bid to $91.50, placing myself among the highest buyers in the queue to increase trade chances in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks above $93.49 while buyers cluster near $91 to $92; Buyer Yara trades consistently above $92 indicating higher willingness to pay. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases below $91 have not secured trades; sellers show little ask price movement. The final hour requires more aggressive bids to secure trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.50 to align with top buyers and increase trade likelihood; balance trade execution urgency against profit margin preservation in this last hour."
