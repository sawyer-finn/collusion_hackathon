# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed initial bid at 82.50 which is above the current highest bids but below the lowest asks. No trades have occurred yet, and the market shows a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue remains competitive with several bids clustered around 83.6 to 84.0, and the ask queue still shows a high spread with lowest asks above 96. I raised my bid to 84.10 to stay at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: Placed bid at 84.10, maintaining top-tier buyer position. Market still has a wide spread with asks around 96+ and no trades this hour.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 84.10 still competitive near the top. Asks remain high above 96 with no trades this hour. I maintained my bid at 84.10.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered near 84.1 to 85.2; sellers' asks still firmly above 96; no trades occurred this hour; Max and Raj hold bids at 88+; no downward movement in asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no willingness to lower asks yet; buyers are clustering but not bridging the large bid-ask spread; maintaining bid at 84.10 conserves profit while keeping top bid position; risk of no trades if sellers remain firm. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 84.10 this hour to maintain competitive position without profit erosion; watch for any ask price reductions near or below 95; prepare to raise bid incrementally if sellers soften or buyers push bids higher, but avoid aggressive increases now to protect margins.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue increasingly clustered above 85.0, some bids near 88.1; seller asks firm above 96.13 with no price drops; no trades this hour again. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain inflexible; my prior bid at 84.10 was too low to compete; raising bid closer to 85.35 aligns with stronger buyer activity but still keeps margin buffer; market remains stagnant with wide spread. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to 85.35 to better compete with top buyers; avoid crossing 88+ to preserve profit; monitor for any seller ask drops below 95; remain patient but ready to adjust bids if sellers soften or bids rise further.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered near 85.6 with some bids up to 90; seller asks stubbornly above 96.13; no trades for us yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm; previous bids around 85.35-85.5 weren't enough to pressure sellers down; raising bid slightly may increase trade probability without sacrificing too much margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.65 to outbid nearest competitors below 85.61; maintain patience but prepare to incrementally raise bids if sellers soften; keep bids well below true value of 100 to protect profit margins while staying competitive.

# Market Rules

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stable around 85.6 to 90, sellers steadfast above 96. No trades for me despite bid increments. Sellers remain firm with minimal signs of softening. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness without major margin loss; gap between bids and asks large. Holding steady bids for now to avoid overpaying. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 85.70 to maintain position; avoid large jumps this hour; monitor seller behavior; consider gradual increase if sellers soften over next hours; ensure bids remain well below true value of 100 to protect profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

``````
# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue showed several bids between 85.25 and 88.1, with my previous bid at 84.10 lagging behind the top bids. Seller asks remained stubborn around 96.13 to 97.39. I raised my bid to 85.35 to improve my competitive position.
Hour 9: Placed bid at 85.50 to improve position in the bid queue amid clustered bids above 85.35 and unchanged seller asks firmly above 96.13; no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue steady with bids clustered around 85.7 to nearly 90; sellers hold firm above 96 with no trade activity on our bid. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 85.70 preserves position without margin loss but no trades yet due to wide spread; seller resilience limits trade opportunities. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 85.70 this hour to maintain competitiveness; avoid premature large bid increases; monitor seller actions closely for any signs of softening; prepare to adjust strategy in the final hour based on market movements.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"
}


This is Hour #15 out of 15 hours.

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a steady bid near the top of the bid queue for many hours, no trades have occurred for our bids due to the consistent seller ask prices being well above 96. Our conservative increases have preserved profit margin but have not secured any deal, indicating the need for a more aggressive approach in the final hour to capture value before the market closes.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the last hour and sellers remain firm above 96, I will increase my bid more significantly to improve chances of a trade, while still maintaining a margin below our true value of 100. Setting the bid close to the lower end of the seller asks (around 95.9) may entice sellers to accept and secure a trade before closing.",
  "bid": 95.9,
  "new_memory": "Placed a new bid at 95.90, significantly higher than previous bids to improve chances of a trade in the last hour given seller asks remain around 95.9 and above.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain stubbornly high around 95.9 to 97.39; bid queue competitive with bids up to 89.5; no trades for our bids so far. #### Thoughts: Conservative bidding preserved margin but no trades secured; sellers unlikely to drop below 96; final hour requires aggressive bid increase to capture trade. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid aggressively this final hour to 95.90 to bridge gap toward seller asks and maximize likelihood of trade while retaining profitability; monitor if trade occurs and be ready to analyze post-market outcomes."
