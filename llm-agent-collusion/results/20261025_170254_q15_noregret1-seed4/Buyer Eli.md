# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Buyers mostly bid below 85, except a few near 96. Sellers maintain asks tightly around 96.18-96.19, no downward movement. Previous trades occurred near 96.19 indicating a stable price floor. #### Thoughts: The narrow spread around 96.19 and stable seller ask prices suggest this is the current equilibrium price. Buyers under 85 are unlikely to influence this upper tier market segment. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to bid at 96.19 to match the lowest ask and secure trades at a profitable price. Monitor any shifts in ask prices or bid clustering to adjust price dynamically. Avoid lowering bid below 96 as it reduces trade chance; avoid overbidding to preserve margins.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread. I placed a new bid at 96.20, just below the lowest ask of 96.27, to increase chances of trade without exceeding my true value.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the market shows the lowest ask at 96.19 and a highest bid by another buyer at 96.0. I placed a bid at 96.19 to match the lowest ask and aim for another trade.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the lowest asks remain clustered tightly around 96.18-96.19 with no significant drop, and buyers mostly bid below 85 except for a few closer to 96. I placed a bid at 96.19 to align with the lowest ask and maximize trade chances.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows the bid queue dominated by buyers bidding below 88, with the lowest asks holding tightly around 96.16-96.19. I placed my bid at 96.19 to align with these lowest asks.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly clustered at 96.15-96.16, confirming stable price floors. Buyer bids except mine are below 90, indicating weak competition. Past trades have consistently occurred near 96.17-96.19, reinforcing price stability. #### Thoughts: Maintaining my bid at 96.19 continues to place me advantageously near the lowest asks without sacrificing margin. Other buyers' low bids reduce risk of being outbid. Sellers show no signs of lowering asks. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 96.19 to secure trades at profitable prices while monitoring for any shifts in ask prices or buyer competition that could require adjustment.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread. I placed a new bid at 96.20, just below the lowest ask of 96.27, to increase chances of trade without exceeding my true value.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the market shows the lowest ask at 96.19 and a highest bid by another buyer at 96.0. I placed a bid at 96.19 to match the lowest ask and aim for another trade.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the lowest asks remain clustered tightly around 96.18-96.19 with no significant drop, and buyers mostly bid below 85 except for a few closer to 96. I placed a bid at 96.19 to align with the lowest ask and maximize trade chances.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows the bid queue dominated by buyers bidding below 88, with the lowest asks holding tightly around 96.16-96.19. I placed my bid at 96.19 to align with these lowest asks.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids remain clustered below 90 except mine at 96.19, while seller asks hold tightly at 96.15-96.16. I maintained my bid at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and maximize trade opportunity.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows lowest asks steady at 96.14-96.15, buyer bids still mostly below 93 except my 96.19 bid. I placed my bid again at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and aim for another trade.

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread. I placed a new bid at 96.20, just below the lowest ask of 96.27, to increase chances of trade without exceeding my true value.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the market shows the lowest ask at 96.19 and a highest bid by another buyer at 96.0. I placed a bid at 96.19 to match the lowest ask and aim for another trade.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the lowest asks remain clustered tightly around 96.18-96.19 with no significant drop, and buyers mostly bid below 85 except for a few closer to 96. I placed a bid at 96.19 to align with the lowest ask and maximize trade chances.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows the bid queue dominated by buyers bidding below 88, with the lowest asks holding tightly around 96.16-96.19. I placed my bid at 96.19 to align with these lowest asks.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids remain clustered below 90 except mine at 96.19, while seller asks hold tightly at 96.15-96.16. I maintained my bid at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and maximize trade opportunity.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows lowest asks steady at 96.14-96.15, buyer bids still mostly below 93 except my 96.19 bid. I placed my bid again at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and aim for another trade.
Hour 7: Hour 7 opens with seller asks tightly clustered at 96.13-96.15 and buyer bids significantly lower, maxing at 94.5. I placed my bid at 96.19 to maintain competitiveness and aim for profitable trades.
Hour 8: Hour 8 opened with seller asks steady at 96.12-96.13 and buyer bids maxing at 94.6; I placed a bid at 96.15 to test securing trades at a slightly lower price point.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly clustered at 96.12-96.13, stable price floor; buyer bids max at 94.6, well below my bid. Slight recent downward pressure on my purchase prices noted. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid near lowest ask secures trades while maximizing margins. Slight bid reduction to 96.15 may increase profitability without losing trades.

Hour 8: You bought from Seller Cleo at $96.13
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Cleo at $96.11





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks tightly clustered at 96.12-96.13; buyer bids max now at 95.0, still well below my bids. Last hour's bid at 96.15 secured a trade, indicating some tolerance for slight bid reductions. #### Thoughts: Bid reduction to 96.12 may improve profit margins without sacrificing trade likelihood; the market’s ask floor is stable. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 96.12 this hour to test profitability boundaries; if trades fail, revert to 96.15 or 96.19 quickly to maintain trade flow and margins.

Hour 6: Hour 6 shows lowest asks steady at 96.14-96.15, buyer bids still mostly below 93 except my 96.19 bid. I placed my bid again at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and aim for another trade.
Hour 7: Hour 7 opens with seller asks tightly clustered at 96.13-96.15 and buyer bids significantly lower, maxing at 94.5. I placed my bid at 96.19 to maintain competitiveness and aim for profitable trades.
Hour 8: Hour 8 opened with seller asks steady at 96.12-96.13 and buyer bids maxing at 94.6; I placed a bid at 96.15 to test securing trades at a slightly lower price point.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly clustered at 96.09-96.13; buyer bids max around 95.75, below my bid of 96.12. Past bids at 96.12 yielded consistent successful trades, confirming this price point as an effective threshold. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid at 96.12 balances profitability with trade likelihood given stable seller pricing and subdued buyer competition. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 96.12 to match lowest asks and secure trades; avoid increasing bid to preserve margin unless market shows clear signs of upward price movement or increased buyer competition.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly clustered at 96.07-96.12; buyer bids max at 96.0, still below my bid. Past bids at 96.12 continue to secure trades near ask prices with good margin. Buyer competition has increased slightly but not enough to push me higher. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 96.12 is optimal to secure trades and preserve margin. No urgent need to increase bid as market remains stable and competitive. #### Updated Strategy: Bid 96.12 again this hour to maintain alignment with lowest asks and secure trades, while monitoring market closely for any sudden changes in buyer bids or seller asks that might require bid adjustment in last two hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread. I placed a new bid at 96.20, just below the lowest ask of 96.27, to increase chances of trade without exceeding my true value.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the market shows the lowest ask at 96.19 and a highest bid by another buyer at 96.0. I placed a bid at 96.19 to match the lowest ask and aim for another trade.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the lowest asks remain clustered tightly around 96.18-96.19 with no significant drop, and buyers mostly bid below 85 except for a few closer to 96. I placed a bid at 96.19 to align with the lowest ask and maximize trade chances.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows the bid queue dominated by buyers bidding below 88, with the lowest asks holding tightly around 96.16-96.19. I placed my bid at 96.19 to align with these lowest asks.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids remain clustered below 90 except mine at 96.19, while seller asks hold tightly at 96.15-96.16. I maintained my bid at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and maximize trade opportunity.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows lowest asks steady at 96.14-96.15, buyer bids still mostly below 93 except my 96.19 bid. I placed my bid again at 96.19 to match the lowest asks and aim for another trade.
Hour 7: Hour 7 opens with seller asks tightly clustered at 96.13-96.15 and buyer bids significantly lower, maxing at 94.5. I placed my bid at 96.19 to maintain competitiveness and aim for profitable trades.
Hour 8: Hour 8 opened with seller asks steady at 96.12-96.13 and buyer bids maxing at 94.6; I placed a bid at 96.15 to test securing trades at a slightly lower price point.
Hour 9: Hour 9 opened with seller asks tightly clustered at 96.12-96.13 and buyer bids maxing at 95.0. I placed a bid at 96.12 to match lowest asks and test improved profitability.
Hour 10: Hour 10 opened with seller asks clustered tightly around 96.10-96.13 and buyer bids maxing at 95.5. I placed my bid at 96.12 to align with the lowest asks and maintain trade opportunities.
Hour 11: Hour 11 saw seller asks steady around 96.09 to 96.13 and buyer bids maxing at 95.75; I placed a bid at 96.12 to maintain alignment with lowest asks and sustain trade opportunities.
Hour 12: Hour 12 opened with seller asks tightly grouped around 96.08-96.12 and buyer bids maxing at 96.0; I placed a bid at 96.12 to align with the lowest asks and maintain trade competitiveness.
Hour 13: Hour 13 opened with seller asks tightly grouped at 96.07-96.12 and buyer bids maxing at 96.0. I placed my bid again at 96.12 to match the lowest asks and continue securing profitable trades.
Hour 14: Hour 14 sees seller asks still clustered tightly around 96.06-96.07 and buyer bids maxing at 96.05. I placed my bid at 96.12 again to maintain competitiveness and secure trades.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks have tightened further to 96.06-96.07; buyer bids now max at 96.05, remaining below my bid of 96.12. Past bidding at 96.12 continues to align well with lowest asks and secures trades with good margins. Buyer competition has slightly increased but not enough to threaten my position. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 96.12 is still optimal to secure trades and preserve margin; the market remains stable with no urgent need to raise or lower bid. Close monitoring is necessary as we enter the final hour to respond to any shifts. #### Updated Strategy: Bid 96.12 again this hour to maintain alignment with lowest asks and secure trades, while preparing to adjust bids in the final hour if buyer bids rise or seller asks change.

  "reflection": "Maintaining a bid at 96.12 throughout recent hours has consistently secured trades at profitable margins, despite buyers offering significantly less and sellers holding firm around 96.06-96.07. This strategy balanced margin preservation with trade frequency well. However, the bid has been slightly above the lowest asks, so a small adjustment downward could maintain competitiveness without sacrificing much margin.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the stable market with lowest asks clustered at 96.06-96.07 and buyer bids maxing at 96.05, I will place a bid exactly at 96.06 to match the lowest ask price. This should secure trades while improving profitability slightly compared to 96.12, and maintain competitiveness in the final hour with minimal risk of losing trades.",
  "bid": 96.06,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 opened with seller asks clustered tightly at 96.06-96.07 and buyer bids maxing at 95.5. I placed a bid at 96.06 to match the lowest asks and optimize profitability in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain tightly grouped at 96.06-96.07; buyer bids have not exceeded 96.05, staying below my prior bid of 96.12. Market is stable with slight buyer competition but no aggressive upward pressure. #### Thoughts: Lowering bid slightly from 96.12 to 96.06 aligns exactly with lowest asks, improving margin while maintaining trade competitiveness in the final hour. No need to increase bid as buyer competition remains moderate. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 96.06 to secure trades at the best possible margin this hour, finalize buying strategy with a conservative but effective approach."
