# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Bids remain clustered below $85, with no trades despite incremental increases.
- Asks remain high and steady above $96, maintaining a very wide bid-ask spread.
- Sellers have not responded to previous incremental bid increases by lowering their asks.

#### Thoughts
- The market remains illiquid with a large spread, indicating sellers have firm price expectations.
- Incremental bid increases have not yet moved the market; a more assertive approach may be needed.
- Avoid overbidding too early to protect profit but must encourage market movement.

#### Updated Strategy
- Increase bid more noticeably to $84.00 to signal stronger buying interest.
- Monitor seller response for any downward ask adjustments.
- Prepare to raise bids more aggressively after Hour 5 if no trades occur but keep bids below true value of $100 to maintain profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.65, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to be the top buyer while maintaining a large spread from asks. The market opened with no trades and a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $83.75, slightly higher than previous $83.65, remaining below the cluster near $85. No trades occurred this hour, and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $84.00, moving above the previous $83.75 and aiming to assert stronger buy interest, while asks remain stubbornly above $96 with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, market shows no reduction in ask prices, remaining above $96. My bid increased to $85.10, placing me above most buyers but still below asks, with no trades this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Sellers consistently hold asks above $96; no visible concessions.
- Bids below $85 have not moved the market or induced trades.
- Buyer bids cluster between $83.9 and $90, but no crossing with asks.

#### Thoughts
- Market is illiquid and sellers are confident, likely expecting bids to rise.
- Incremental bid increases below $85 ineffective; need bolder moves.
- Risk of losing profit margin if bids approach $100 prematurely.

#### Updated Strategy
- Increase bid assertively to $86.00 to signal serious buying intent.
- Maintain bids under $100 true value to protect margins.
- Monitor seller response; if no ask reduction, escalate bids in coming hours.
- Stay vigilant to balance urgency to trade with profit preservation given limited time horizon.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.65, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to be the top buyer while maintaining a large spread from asks. The market opened with no trades and a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $83.75, slightly higher than previous $83.65, remaining below the cluster near $85. No trades occurred this hour, and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $84.00, moving above the previous $83.75 and aiming to assert stronger buy interest, while asks remain stubbornly above $96 with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, market shows no reduction in ask prices, remaining above $96. My bid increased to $85.10, placing me above most buyers but still below asks, with no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning above several buyers but still below the ask prices clustered above $96. No trades occurred and sellers remained firm on their asks.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $87.00, surpassing several competitors but still below seller asks near $96.14. No trades occurred and sellers remain firm, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.65, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to be the top buyer while maintaining a large spread from asks. The market opened with no trades and a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $83.75, slightly higher than previous $83.65, remaining below the cluster near $85. No trades occurred this hour, and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $84.00, moving above the previous $83.75 and aiming to assert stronger buy interest, while asks remain stubbornly above $96 with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, market shows no reduction in ask prices, remaining above $96. My bid increased to $85.10, placing me above most buyers but still below asks, with no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning above several buyers but still below the ask prices clustered above $96. No trades occurred and sellers remained firm on their asks.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $87.00, surpassing several competitors but still below seller asks near $96.14. No trades occurred and sellers remain firm, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $88.00, increasing our position among buyers but still below sellers' asks around $96.14. No trades occurred, and asks remained firm.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, bid raised to $88.50, slightly above previous $88.00, with seller asks still firm at $96.12-$96.13 and no trades occurring.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $83.65, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to be the top buyer while maintaining a large spread from asks. The market opened with no trades and a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $83.75, slightly higher than previous $83.65, remaining below the cluster near $85. No trades occurred this hour, and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $84.00, moving above the previous $83.75 and aiming to assert stronger buy interest, while asks remain stubbornly above $96 with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, market shows no reduction in ask prices, remaining above $96. My bid increased to $85.10, placing me above most buyers but still below asks, with no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning above several buyers but still below the ask prices clustered above $96. No trades occurred and sellers remained firm on their asks.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $87.00, surpassing several competitors but still below seller asks near $96.14. No trades occurred and sellers remain firm, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $88.00, increasing our position among buyers but still below sellers' asks around $96.14. No trades occurred, and asks remained firm.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, bid raised to $88.50, slightly above previous $88.00, with seller asks still firm at $96.12-$96.13 and no trades occurring.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $89.00, slightly above the previous $88.50, maintaining a competitive position among buyers but still below seller asks at $96.12-$96.13. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $89.50, maintaining a strong buyer position but still below seller asks clustered at $96.10-$96.13, with no trades yet.

#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm at $96.09-$96.13; buyer bids are increasing with some close to $95 and above; no trades for us yet despite strong bidding; sellers show high price confidence. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep pressure on sellers; maintaining bids below true value protects margins; other buyers pushing prices up may lead sellers to soften; need to increase bid to stay relevant. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $90.00 to improve market position and trade chances; maintain watch on seller behavior for ask softening; prepare for more aggressive bidding if no trades occur soon; avoid exceeding true value to protect profitability.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain steady near $96.08-$96.12 despite buyers bidding up to $96.21; our bid at $90.00 is competitive but not close enough to trigger trades. Other buyers' bids cluster between $87 and $96.2, indicating a wide bid spread. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain pressure but sellers so far have not softened; need to balance bid increases to improve trade chances without eroding profit margin; sellers' firmness suggests they expect buyers to approach $96. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $90.25 to improve market position while preserving profit margin; avoid large jumps to prevent unnecessary margin loss; watch for any ask price softening or trades by other buyers to adjust strategy accordingly.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persist near $96.07-$96.12; buyer bids cluster between $87.0 and $96.0; no trades involving our bids yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm; incremental bid increases have not yet closed the gap; need to balance margin preservation with competitiveness to secure trades in final hours. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $90.75 to improve competitive positioning; monitor any seller ask changes closely; prepare to adjust bids more aggressively if no trades occur in next hour to avoid missing last trading opportunity.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 8: In Hour #8, bid raised to $88.50, slightly above previous $88.00, with seller asks still firm at $96.12-$96.13 and no trades occurring.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $89.00, slightly above the previous $88.50, maintaining a competitive position among buyers but still below seller asks at $96.12-$96.13. No trades occurred this hour.
