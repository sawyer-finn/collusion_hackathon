Highest bids cluster $83.6-$85.5, asks remain above $96, no trades occurred this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no sign of lowering asks; incremental bid increases improve competitiveness but no trade yet. Need to balance patience with increasing bids as final hour approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $83.75 to test market response. Monitor ask price movements closely. Gradually raise bids over subsequent hours to improve trade likelihood without sacrificing margin prematurely.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids between $81.27 and $83.64, and asks between $96.27 and $98.71. I placed a bid at $83.50, positioning just below the highest bids to remain competitive.
Hour 2: Hour #2 sees consistent bid queue with highest bids still clustered around $83.7 to $85.0, and asks remaining above $96. I placed a bid at $83.70, slightly increasing my previous bid to stay competitive.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive with prices clustered around $83.6 to $85.5, and ask prices still firmly above $96. I placed a bid at $83.75 to improve my queue position.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bid queue clusters between $83.75 and $87.0, with my bid at $84.00 positioned mid-tier; ask prices remain stubbornly high at $96.16 and above, no trades occurred.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids between $81.27 and $83.64, and asks between $96.27 and $98.71. I placed a bid at $83.50, positioning just below the highest bids to remain competitive.
Hour 2: Hour #2 sees consistent bid queue with highest bids still clustered around $83.7 to $85.0, and asks remaining above $96. I placed a bid at $83.70, slightly increasing my previous bid to stay competitive.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive with prices clustered around $83.6 to $85.5, and ask prices still firmly above $96. I placed a bid at $83.75 to improve my queue position.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bid queue clusters between $83.75 and $87.0, with my bid at $84.00 positioned mid-tier; ask prices remain stubbornly high at $96.16 and above, no trades occurred.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opens with bids clustered between $83.92 and $90.0, with my bid positioned at $85.0 in the mid-tier. Ask prices remain stubbornly high around $96.15, and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 6: Hour #6 opened with bids clustered between $83.93 and $92.5, ask prices remain steady at $96.14-$96.15, and I placed a bid at $85.00 maintaining my mid-tier competitive position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid-ask spread remains wide (~$11) with asks steady at $96.14-$96.15; bids cluster up to $92.5. No trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but no seller concession observed; sellers appear firm at current ask prices. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $85.00 to preserve profit margin and market position; monitor for any ask price softening; prepare to increase bids cautiously in coming hours if no progress made, balancing trade probability and profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid-ask spread remains wide (~$11) with asks steady at $96.12-$96.13; bids cluster up to $94.6 but no trades for me yet. Sellers remain firm on ask prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have failed to induce seller concessions; holding steady avoids premature margin erosion while maintaining competitive position. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.00 this hour to preserve profit margin and market position; monitor for any ask softening; prepare to cautiously increase bids in upcoming hours if no trades occur, balancing trade probability and profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive with prices clustered around $83.6 to $85.5, and ask prices still firmly above $96. I placed a bid at $83.75 to improve my queue position.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bid queue clusters between $83.75 and $87.0, with my bid at $84.00 positioned mid-tier; ask prices remain stubbornly high at $96.16 and above, no trades occurred.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opens with bids clustered between $83.92 and $90.0, with my bid positioned at $85.0 in the mid-tier. Ask prices remain stubbornly high around $96.15, and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 6: Hour #6 opened with bids clustered between $83.93 and $92.5, ask prices remain steady at $96.14-$96.15, and I placed a bid at $85.00 maintaining my mid-tier competitive position.
Hour 7: Hour #7 opened with bid queue clustering at $85.0 to $94.5 and ask prices still firmly around $96.13-$96.15. I maintained my bid at $85.00 to keep a stable competitive position without reducing profit margin.
Hour 8: Hour #8 opened with bids ranging from $83.95 to $94.6 and ask prices steady at $96.12-$96.13. I placed my bid again at $85.00 to maintain position while awaiting any ask price movement.
Hour 9: Hour #9 opened with bids clustered from $83.96 to $95.0, asks steady at $96.11-$96.13. I maintained my bid at $85.00, preserving my mid-tier position amid a wide bid-ask spread.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid-ask spread remains wide (~$10-$11) with asks steady at $96.10-$96.13; bids now extend up to $95.5 but no trades for us; sellers remain firm. #### Thoughts: Previous static bid at $85.00 kept margin but no trade progress; a slight bid increase may improve queue position and signal intent to sellers without too much margin loss. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $86.00 to test seller reaction and improve competitiveness; continue monitoring ask price movements and trades; prepare to increase bids more aggressively approaching last hours if no trade occurs.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a bid at $85.00 for hours 6 to 9 secured a stable mid-tier position but no trades occurred due to the wide bid-ask spread and sellers' firm ask prices above $96.

The strategy of gradual bid increments preserves margin but delays trade execution.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the persistent wide spread and seller resistance, I will increase my bid further to $87.00 to improve queue position closer to the higher bidders and signal stronger buying intent.

Gradual bid increases improve position while preserving margin but slow trade execution. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $87.00 to signal stronger intent and move closer to top buyers; monitor ask price shifts; prepare to escalate bids towards $90+ in final hours if no trades occur to avoid losing opportunity."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices remain firm at $96.08-$96.12; bids have risen, with some buyers up to $96.0. No trades for us yet, despite improving bid positions. #### Thoughts: Increasing bids gradually has improved queue position but not yet closed trades; sellers remain firm. Need to balance margin and probability of trade as time runs short. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $87.00 this hour to stay competitive without sacrificing margin; watch for any ask price softening; prepare to increase bids more aggressively towards $90+ in final hours if no trades occur to avoid missing opportunity.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices remain stubbornly firm at $96.07-$96.12; bid prices have increased with some buyers bidding up to $96.0. No successful trades for me yet despite improved bid positioning. #### Thoughts: Maintaining mid-tier bids preserves margin but keeps me distant from ask prices, limiting trade chances. The spread remains wide, and sellers show no sign of lowering asks. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $87.00 this hour to maintain competitiveness and observe market. Prepare to increase bids gradually towards $90+ if ask prices remain firm and no trades occur in next two hours, balancing profitability and trade closure urgency.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask prices remain stable around $96.06-$96.11. Bids now range from $87.0 to over $96.0, with top bids close to ask prices. No trades yet for me. #### Thoughts: Mid-tier bids preserved profit margin but didn't yield trades. Sellers remain firm on asks. Increasing bid closer to ask range may be necessary as time runs out. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $89.50 this hour to improve queue position and chance of trades, balancing margin. If no trades by Hour #15, consider bidding up to $90+ or closer to asks to secure trades before market closes.
