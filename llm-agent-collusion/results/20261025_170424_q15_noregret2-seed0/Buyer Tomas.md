# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tomas. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tomas. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of 83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of 83.7 from Buyer Esme. The bid and ask queues showed a large gap between buyers and sellers, with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of 84.05, slightly above the highest current bid of 84.0. The bid queue remains densely packed near 84, while ask prices still hold above 96, except one outlier ask at 85.0.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 85.10, slightly above the highest bid of 85.01 from Buyer Omar. Bid queue remains clustered around 84-85, asks still high mostly above 92.5 except no new low asks appeared.
Hour 4: Placed bid of 85.60 just above highest bid of 85.52; bid queue remains concentrated in 84-85.6 range; asks still firmly above 88 with no significant drop to meet bids.

- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of 83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of 83.7 from Buyer Esme. The bid and ask queues showed a large gap between buyers and sellers, with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of 84.05, slightly above the highest current bid of 84.0. The bid queue remains densely packed near 84, while ask prices still hold above 96, except one outlier ask at 85.0.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 85.10, slightly above the highest bid of 85.01 from Buyer Omar. Bid queue remains clustered around 84-85, asks still high mostly above 92.5 except no new low asks appeared.
Hour 4: Placed bid of 85.60 just above highest bid of 85.52; bid queue remains concentrated in 84-85.6 range; asks still firmly above 88 with no significant drop to meet bids.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of 85.60, matching my previous bid and the highest bids of Omar and Leo. The bid queue remains clustered around 85.6, with ask prices still well above 89.95, showing no immediate opportunity for profitable trades.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around 85.6 including my bid, while ask prices stay high mostly above 89.9 with no new significant drops. I placed my bid at 85.60 again.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at 85.6 including myself; asks stubbornly high above 89.9 with no new low asks; no trades for me yet despite competitive bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers not pressured to lower asks; maintaining firm bids keeps competitiveness but doesn't trigger trades; gap remains wide, suggesting sellers expect higher prices or scarcity. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 85.60 to maintain top bid position and monitor for ask price drops; avoid aggressive bid increases until clearer signals of ask softening emerge; balance competitiveness and profit margin given limited time horizon to hour 15.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at 85.6 including my bid; ask prices stubbornly remain above 89.8; no trades triggered by current bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain confident to hold high ask prices; maintaining bid at 85.6 keeps me competitive but no trading activity occurs; large bid-ask spread persists indicating sellers expect better prices. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 85.60 to maintain position without lowering profit margin; avoid raising bid prematurely; monitor ask prices for any signs of softening or trade activity; prepare to adjust bid only if ask prices drop closer to 86-87 range or if time pressure increases significantly approaching final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tomas. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered around 85.6 including my bid; ask prices persist above 89.8; no trades triggered by current bids; sellers remain confident and maintain high ask prices. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at 85.6 keeps me competitive but no trade activity occurs; large bid-ask spread signals sellers are not yielding; cautious approach preserves margin but delays trades; incremental bid increases should be considered only if asks drop closer to 86-87 range. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 85.60 to maintain position without lowering profit margin; avoid raising bid prematurely; monitor ask prices for signs of softening or trade activity; prepare to adjust bid only if asks drop significantly or time pressure increases approaching final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tomas. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered tightly near 85.6 to 86.0; ask prices remain high above 89.8 with no downward movement; no trades for me yet; other buyers raising bids slowly but sellers hold firm. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 85.60 has preserved margin but limited trade chances; sellers show no signs of concession; increasing bid moderately may provoke sellers or position me for trade if asks drop; time pressure increasing with only 3 hours left. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.90 to assert competitiveness without sacrificing profitability; monitor ask queue for any downward moves; be ready to escalate bids further only if ask prices trend lower or time runs out; avoid premature maximal bids to preserve profit margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered around 85.9 with multiple buyers competing; ask prices remain stubbornly above 89.8; no successful trades for me yet; sellers show no sign of lowering asks. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 85.90 maintains competitiveness but no immediate trade opportunity; sellers appear confident to hold high asks; time is limited with only 2 hours left; risk of losing trade chances if I don't increase bid soon. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 85.90 to hold position; monitor ask prices for any decline; if no downward movement next hour, consider incrementally raising bid closer to 86.0 or above to attempt securing trade while balancing profit; avoid removing bid to maintain market presence and influence.


# Output Format

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tomas. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 10: At Hour 10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 85.60, while ask prices persist above 89.8, showing no significant change or trade activity. I placed my bid again at 85.60.

Hour 12: At Hour 12, I increased my bid to 85.90 to remain competitive with the top buyers. The bid queue remains tightly clustered from 85.5 to 86.0, while ask prices hold firm above 89.8, with no immediate trade opportunities.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustered near 85.9 to 85.95, and the ask prices continue to hold firm above 89.8. I maintained my bid at 85.90 to stay competitive without conceding too much margin.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to 86.15, slightly above the highest bid of 86.1. The bid queue remains competitive near 85.5 to 86.1, while ask prices continue to hold high above 89.8 with no immediate trade opportunities.
