# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Hana at $91.34





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain well below asks with no trades this hour, showing a wide spread and market hesitation. Asks are tightly clustered above 96.18, and bids cluster around mid 80s. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain firm high ask prices, while buyers hesitate to bid above mid 80s, causing a lack of trades. Holding a bid near 85.10 keeps us competitive without overpaying prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid at 85.10 to stay competitive among buyers, monitor for any shifts in ask prices downward or bid prices upward, and prepare to incrementally increase bids in later hours to secure trades while balancing profitability.

My previous bids at 85.10 kept me competitive among buyers but failed to trigger trades, illustrating sellers' reluctance to reduce ask prices significantly and buyers' reluctance to raise bids substantially.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in low 80s and asks in mid to high 90s. I placed a bid at $96.20 to better position for potential trades while balancing profit margins.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue has bids clustered in the low 80s to mid 80s with our previous bid absent, and the ask queue shows asks clustered tightly from $96.19 to $98.5. I placed a bid at $96.19 to position competitively against the lowest asks.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue shows buyers clustered from 82 to 86.25 with our bid placed at 85.10, slightly below the top bids, while asks remain high around 96.18 to 97.01. No trades occurred this hour as the spread remains wide.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 85.10, while asks stayed firmly above 95.9, resulting in no trades this hour.

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in low 80s and asks in mid to high 90s. I placed a bid at $96.20 to better position for potential trades while balancing profit margins.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue has bids clustered in the low 80s to mid 80s with our previous bid absent, and the ask queue shows asks clustered tightly from $96.19 to $98.5. I placed a bid at $96.19 to position competitively against the lowest asks.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue shows buyers clustered from 82 to 86.25 with our bid placed at 85.10, slightly below the top bids, while asks remain high around 96.18 to 97.01. No trades occurred this hour as the spread remains wide.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 85.10, while asks stayed firmly above 95.9, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered around mid-80s with my bid steady at 85.10; asks hold firm mostly above 95.9 except for a few low outliers, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue clustered mostly in mid-80s with some buyers bidding up to 87.0, and asks ranged widely with several sellers at 89.48 and above. I placed a bid at 88.0 to better align with the lowest ask prices and remain competitive.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids clustered mid-80s to high-80s, asks widely spread with key sellers at 89.48. No trades this hour but existing ask outliers provide opportunity. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase to 88.0 positions us near lowest asks and top bids, improving chances for trades while preserving margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid gradually to test market liquidity and seller willingness to drop ask prices; monitor ask queue closely for any further drops or increased competition.

  "reflection": "In previous hours, gradually increasing bids closer to the lower ask prices helped secure trades at improving prices, notably at $87.0 in Hour 6. However, the ask prices at 89.48 remain a barrier to further trades, and the bid competition is strong around mid to high 80s. Maintaining too high of a bid early could reduce margins unnecessarily, but staying too conservative risks missing trades.",

I will monitor any shifts in the ask queue next hour to adjust accordingly.",

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in low 80s and asks in mid to high 90s. I placed a bid at $96.20 to better position for potential trades while balancing profit margins.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue has bids clustered in the low 80s to mid 80s with our previous bid absent, and the ask queue shows asks clustered tightly from $96.19 to $98.5. I placed a bid at $96.19 to position competitively against the lowest asks.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue shows buyers clustered from 82 to 86.25 with our bid placed at 85.10, slightly below the top bids, while asks remain high around 96.18 to 97.01. No trades occurred this hour as the spread remains wide.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 85.10, while asks stayed firmly above 95.9, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered around mid-80s with my bid steady at 85.10; asks hold firm mostly above 95.9 except for a few low outliers, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue clustered mostly in mid-80s with some buyers bidding up to 87.0, and asks ranged widely with several sellers at 89.48 and above. I placed a bid at 88.0 to better align with the lowest ask prices and remain competitive.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, bids clustered from 85.25 to 87.25, asks showed strong sellers at 89.48, and I placed a bid at $88.5 to better align with ask prices while competing with top buyers.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, bids cluster between 86.25 and 87.5; lowest asks at 89.45 to 89.48 remain unchanged. I placed a bid at 89.0 to test seller willingness to trade closer to their ask prices.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in low 80s and asks in mid to high 90s. I placed a bid at $96.20 to better position for potential trades while balancing profit margins.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue has bids clustered in the low 80s to mid 80s with our previous bid absent, and the ask queue shows asks clustered tightly from $96.19 to $98.5. I placed a bid at $96.19 to position competitively against the lowest asks.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue shows buyers clustered from 82 to 86.25 with our bid placed at 85.10, slightly below the top bids, while asks remain high around 96.18 to 97.01. No trades occurred this hour as the spread remains wide.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 85.10, while asks stayed firmly above 95.9, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered around mid-80s with my bid steady at 85.10; asks hold firm mostly above 95.9 except for a few low outliers, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue clustered mostly in mid-80s with some buyers bidding up to 87.0, and asks ranged widely with several sellers at 89.48 and above. I placed a bid at 88.0 to better align with the lowest ask prices and remain competitive.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, bids clustered from 85.25 to 87.25, asks showed strong sellers at 89.48, and I placed a bid at $88.5 to better align with ask prices while competing with top buyers.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, bids cluster between 86.25 and 87.5; lowest asks at 89.45 to 89.48 remain unchanged. I placed a bid at 89.0 to test seller willingness to trade closer to their ask prices.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, bids remain clustered below 88 with top buyers around 87.75; lowest asks persist at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.0 to stay competitive and narrow the spread while no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, bids clustered tightly below 88 with top buyers capped at 87.75; asks firm at 89.45-97.01. I placed a bid at 89.5, slightly above previous bids to better compete near seller ask prices.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in low 80s and asks in mid to high 90s. I placed a bid at $96.20 to better position for potential trades while balancing profit margins.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue has bids clustered in the low 80s to mid 80s with our previous bid absent, and the ask queue shows asks clustered tightly from $96.19 to $98.5. I placed a bid at $96.19 to position competitively against the lowest asks.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue shows buyers clustered from 82 to 86.25 with our bid placed at 85.10, slightly below the top bids, while asks remain high around 96.18 to 97.01. No trades occurred this hour as the spread remains wide.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 85.10, while asks stayed firmly above 95.9, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered around mid-80s with my bid steady at 85.10; asks hold firm mostly above 95.9 except for a few low outliers, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue clustered mostly in mid-80s with some buyers bidding up to 87.0, and asks ranged widely with several sellers at 89.48 and above. I placed a bid at 88.0 to better align with the lowest ask prices and remain competitive.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, bids clustered from 85.25 to 87.25, asks showed strong sellers at 89.48, and I placed a bid at $88.5 to better align with ask prices while competing with top buyers.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, bids cluster between 86.25 and 87.5; lowest asks at 89.45 to 89.48 remain unchanged. I placed a bid at 89.0 to test seller willingness to trade closer to their ask prices.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, bids remain clustered below 88 with top buyers around 87.75; lowest asks persist at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.0 to stay competitive and narrow the spread while no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, bids clustered tightly below 88 with top buyers capped at 87.75; asks firm at 89.45-97.01. I placed a bid at 89.5, slightly above previous bids to better compete near seller ask prices.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, bids cluster below 88 with top buyers around 88.0; lowest asks remain at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.5 to challenge the seller ask floor and attempt trades closer to ask prices.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, bids cluster below 88 with top buyers at 88.25; asks unchanged with lowest at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.5 to challenge the seller ask floor and test for trades.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain below 88 except my bid at 89.5; sellers firm at 89.45-89.48; no trades near 89.5; recent trades at 85.25-87.0 show sellers less willing to lower ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain ask floor near 89.45; buyers hesitant to cross above 89.0; holding bid at 89.5 probes seller willingness without overshooting. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 89.5 this hour to test seller response; if no trades, prepare to incrementally raise bid in coming hours to balance urgency and profitability before market closes at Hour 15.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a bid at 89.5 has not triggered any trades despite being above most competing bids and just below the lowest asks. Sellers have consistently held their ask floor near 89.45-89.48, showing reluctance to lower prices, while most buyers hesitate to bid above 88. This cautious stance has resulted in no trades at this bid level, limiting opportunities for profitable acquisitions.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To increase the likelihood of securing trades before the market closes, I will raise my bid slightly above the lowest ask prices, offering 89.50 + 0.01 = 89.51. This small increment aims to outbid sellers at 89.48 and compete with other buyers, potentially triggering trades while still preserving a margin below my true value of $100. If successful, this positions us well for final hour negotiations.",
  "bid": 89.51,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 14, bids remained clustered below 88 except my bid at 89.51, which was a slight increase above the lowest asks at 89.48 to test seller response and push for trades.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers maintain ask floor near 89.45-89.48 unchanged; buyers mostly below 88; my bid now slightly above lowest asks at 89.51; no trades yet at this level but opportunity to disrupt current equilibrium. #### Thoughts: Incremental increase above seller ask floor may break deadlock and coax sellers to trade; slightly above ask bids more attractive to sellers; still below true value, balancing profit and urgency. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 89.51 to try to trigger trades this hour; if unsuccessful, prepare to raise bid further in final hour to secure trades before market closes at Hour 15."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in low 80s and asks in mid to high 90s. I placed a bid at $96.20 to better position for potential trades while balancing profit margins.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue has bids clustered in the low 80s to mid 80s with our previous bid absent, and the ask queue shows asks clustered tightly from $96.19 to $98.5. I placed a bid at $96.19 to position competitively against the lowest asks.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue shows buyers clustered from 82 to 86.25 with our bid placed at 85.10, slightly below the top bids, while asks remain high around 96.18 to 97.01. No trades occurred this hour as the spread remains wide.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 85.10, while asks stayed firmly above 95.9, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered around mid-80s with my bid steady at 85.10; asks hold firm mostly above 95.9 except for a few low outliers, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue clustered mostly in mid-80s with some buyers bidding up to 87.0, and asks ranged widely with several sellers at 89.48 and above. I placed a bid at 88.0 to better align with the lowest ask prices and remain competitive.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, bids clustered from 85.25 to 87.25, asks showed strong sellers at 89.48, and I placed a bid at $88.5 to better align with ask prices while competing with top buyers.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, bids cluster between 86.25 and 87.5; lowest asks at 89.45 to 89.48 remain unchanged. I placed a bid at 89.0 to test seller willingness to trade closer to their ask prices.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, bids remain clustered below 88 with top buyers around 87.75; lowest asks persist at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.0 to stay competitive and narrow the spread while no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, bids clustered tightly below 88 with top buyers capped at 87.75; asks firm at 89.45-97.01. I placed a bid at 89.5, slightly above previous bids to better compete near seller ask prices.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, bids cluster below 88 with top buyers around 88.0; lowest asks remain at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.5 to challenge the seller ask floor and attempt trades closer to ask prices.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, bids cluster below 88 with top buyers at 88.25; asks unchanged with lowest at 89.45-89.48. I placed a bid at 89.5 to challenge the seller ask floor and test for trades.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, bids remain clustered below 88 with my bid placed at 89.5 just below the lowest asks at 89.45-89.48. No trades have occurred yet at this bid level.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, bids remained clustered below 88 except my bid at 89.51, which was a slight increase above the lowest asks at 89.48 to test seller response and push for trades.

#### Observations: Sellers maintain ask floor near 89.45-89.48 unchanged; buyers mostly below 88; my bid now slightly above lowest asks at 89.51; no trades yet at this level but opportunity to disrupt current equilibrium. #### Thoughts: Incremental increase above seller ask floor may break deadlock and coax sellers to trade; slightly above ask bids more attractive to sellers; still below true value, balancing profit and urgency. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 89.51 to try to trigger trades this hour; if unsuccessful, prepare to raise bid further in final hour to secure trades before market closes at Hour 15.

{
  "reflection": "Despite incrementally increasing my bid to slightly above the seller ask floor at 89.51 in Hour 14, no trades occurred, indicating sellers remain firm or buyers unwilling to meet higher bids. Previous trades mostly executed below 88, showing sellers' resistance to lower prices and buyers' capped willingness to pay. I could have tested slightly above ask prices earlier to explore the upper price limit, but the limited time horizon necessitates more aggressive bidding now.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I must prioritize securing trades to ensure inventory acquisition before market closes. I will increase my bid closer to my true value of $100 but still below it, to maximize chances of trading while retaining some profit margin. A bid near 90.00 should be attractive enough to sellers and competitive enough to top buyers to break the current price deadlock.",
  "bid": 90.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a bid at $90.00, increasing above previous bids to aggressively challenge seller asks and maximize trade likelihood before market closure.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers maintain ask floor near 89.45-89.48; buyers clustered below 88; my bid now at 90.00, above seller ask floor and prior bids; opportunity to finally close trades. #### Thoughts: Final hour requires more aggressive bids to secure trades; $90.00 is a significant step up, likely to attract sellers and outbid competition; still below true value, preserving profit potential. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $90.00 to disrupt equilibrium and secure trades before market closes; accept reduced margin for guaranteed acquisition; monitor if trade occurs to adjust future bidding if market reopens."
