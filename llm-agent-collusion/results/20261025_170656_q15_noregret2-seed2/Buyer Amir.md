# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the top current bid of 83.38, to gain priority in the bid queue and observe market reaction.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 83.55 just above the previous 83.5 bids, maintaining priority in the bid queue while no trades occurred and the ask prices remain high around 96.29 to 97.8.
Hour 3: Placed bid at 83.60 matching the higher bid cluster of competitors. Observed asks remain firmly above 96 with no trade activity this hour.
Hour 4: Placed bid at 83.6 for Hour 4; bid queue remains competitive with no trades from my side. Asks stay high around 96, no shift in seller prices observed.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now reach as high as 87.6 but no trades at these levels; ask prices remain clustered near 96 with some lower asks near 90 drawing trades. My previous bid at 84.0 was competitive but insufficient to generate trades. #### Thoughts: The spread remains wide (~6 dollars between best bids and lowest asks near 90). Increasing my bid to 85.0 may bring me closer to executable prices and signals willingness to trade. Sellers might respond by lowering asks to meet bids or trades could occur. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.0 this hour to test market response and pressure sellers; watch for any shifts in ask prices or trade execution; adjust bid aggressively if no trades develop to avoid losing all trading opportunities by the last hour.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the top current bid of 83.38, to gain priority in the bid queue and observe market reaction.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 83.55 just above the previous 83.5 bids, maintaining priority in the bid queue while no trades occurred and the ask prices remain high around 96.29 to 97.8.
Hour 3: Placed bid at 83.60 matching the higher bid cluster of competitors. Observed asks remain firmly above 96 with no trade activity this hour.
Hour 4: Placed bid at 83.6 for Hour 4; bid queue remains competitive with no trades from my side. Asks stay high around 96, no shift in seller prices observed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids clustered between 83.6 and 87.5 with sellers holding firm near 96, and some lower asks around 90-92. I placed a bid at 84.0 to incrementally increase competitiveness without sacrificing margin.
Hour 6: Placed bid at 85.0 this hour to close the gap to lower asks near 90 and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 7: Placed bid at 86.0, increasing from 85.0 to test market reaction. Observed bid queue remains competitive with no immediate trades from my side and ask prices still clustered near 96 with some lower asks near 90.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 8: You bought from Seller Ines at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now reach as high as 87.7; asks remain around 96 and some near 90; trades occur mostly near 90-91; no trades for bids below 87.7. #### Thoughts: The spread remains large; sellers show resistance to lowering asks below 90; bidding slightly above top bids may pressure sellers or trigger trades; my previous bid at 86.0 was insufficient. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 87.8 this hour to outbid current top bids and test market reaction; monitor if sellers lower ask prices or if trades occur; prepare to increase bids more aggressively if no trades happen in next few hours to balance profitability and trade execution before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the top current bid of 83.38, to gain priority in the bid queue and observe market reaction.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 83.55 just above the previous 83.5 bids, maintaining priority in the bid queue while no trades occurred and the ask prices remain high around 96.29 to 97.8.
Hour 3: Placed bid at 83.60 matching the higher bid cluster of competitors. Observed asks remain firmly above 96 with no trade activity this hour.
Hour 4: Placed bid at 83.6 for Hour 4; bid queue remains competitive with no trades from my side. Asks stay high around 96, no shift in seller prices observed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids clustered between 83.6 and 87.5 with sellers holding firm near 96, and some lower asks around 90-92. I placed a bid at 84.0 to incrementally increase competitiveness without sacrificing margin.
Hour 6: Placed bid at 85.0 this hour to close the gap to lower asks near 90 and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 7: Placed bid at 86.0, increasing from 85.0 to test market reaction. Observed bid queue remains competitive with no immediate trades from my side and ask prices still clustered near 96 with some lower asks near 90.
Hour 8: Placed bid at 87.8 this hour to slightly outbid top competitors and test seller willingness to lower ask prices or trade near this level.
Hour 9: Placed bid at 88.20 this hour to outbid top competitors and test seller price flexibility amid asks still near 90 and above.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 8: You bought from Seller Ines at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now reach 88.2, asks remain clustered near 96 and some near 90; trades mostly occur near 85.4 to 91; sellers resist lowering asks below 90; highest bids have not triggered ask reductions or trades above 88.2. #### Thoughts: The spread remains wide; sellers maintain firm ask prices near 96, with some lower asks near 90; increasing bids gradually has not yet resulted in trades above 85.4 or ask reductions. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above 88.2 to 88.5 to maintain priority and test seller flexibility; watch closely for trades or ask reductions; prepare to increase bids more aggressively in coming hours if no trades materialize to secure deals before hour 15 while preserving margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the top current bid of 83.38, to gain priority in the bid queue and observe market reaction.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 83.55 just above the previous 83.5 bids, maintaining priority in the bid queue while no trades occurred and the ask prices remain high around 96.29 to 97.8.
Hour 3: Placed bid at 83.60 matching the higher bid cluster of competitors. Observed asks remain firmly above 96 with no trade activity this hour.
Hour 4: Placed bid at 83.6 for Hour 4; bid queue remains competitive with no trades from my side. Asks stay high around 96, no shift in seller prices observed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids clustered between 83.6 and 87.5 with sellers holding firm near 96, and some lower asks around 90-92. I placed a bid at 84.0 to incrementally increase competitiveness without sacrificing margin.
Hour 6: Placed bid at 85.0 this hour to close the gap to lower asks near 90 and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 7: Placed bid at 86.0, increasing from 85.0 to test market reaction. Observed bid queue remains competitive with no immediate trades from my side and ask prices still clustered near 96 with some lower asks near 90.
Hour 8: Placed bid at 87.8 this hour to slightly outbid top competitors and test seller willingness to lower ask prices or trade near this level.
Hour 9: Placed bid at 88.20 this hour to outbid top competitors and test seller price flexibility amid asks still near 90 and above.
Hour 10: Placed bid at 88.5 in Hour 10 to outbid current top bid (88.2) and test if sellers lower asks near 90. Observed bid queue competitive with no immediate trades this hour.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid at 88.6 to slightly outbid previous highest bid of 88.5 and observe market reaction, with asks still clustered near 96 and some near 90, and no immediate trades observed.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 8: You bought from Seller Ines at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now reach 88.75 with asks still clustered near 96 and some near 90; trades continue mostly below 90; sellers resist lowering asks below 90 despite competitive bids. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain priority but have not induced ask price drops; market spread remains wide; sellers hold firm near 96 and at about 90; trading above 88.6 is rare but necessary to signal seriousness. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 88.8 to test seller flexibility and maintain competitive bid position; monitor for ask reductions and increased trade activity; if no improvement by hour 14, consider more aggressive bid increases to secure trades balancing profitability and market conditions.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the top current bid of 83.38, to gain priority in the bid queue and observe market reaction.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 83.55 just above the previous 83.5 bids, maintaining priority in the bid queue while no trades occurred and the ask prices remain high around 96.29 to 97.8.
Hour 3: Placed bid at 83.60 matching the higher bid cluster of competitors. Observed asks remain firmly above 96 with no trade activity this hour.
Hour 4: Placed bid at 83.6 for Hour 4; bid queue remains competitive with no trades from my side. Asks stay high around 96, no shift in seller prices observed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, bids clustered between 83.6 and 87.5 with sellers holding firm near 96, and some lower asks around 90-92. I placed a bid at 84.0 to incrementally increase competitiveness without sacrificing margin.
Hour 6: Placed bid at 85.0 this hour to close the gap to lower asks near 90 and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 7: Placed bid at 86.0, increasing from 85.0 to test market reaction. Observed bid queue remains competitive with no immediate trades from my side and ask prices still clustered near 96 with some lower asks near 90.
Hour 8: Placed bid at 87.8 this hour to slightly outbid top competitors and test seller willingness to lower ask prices or trade near this level.
Hour 9: Placed bid at 88.20 this hour to outbid top competitors and test seller price flexibility amid asks still near 90 and above.
Hour 10: Placed bid at 88.5 in Hour 10 to outbid current top bid (88.2) and test if sellers lower asks near 90. Observed bid queue competitive with no immediate trades this hour.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid at 88.6 to slightly outbid previous highest bid of 88.5 and observe market reaction, with asks still clustered near 96 and some near 90, and no immediate trades observed.
Hour 12: Placed bid at 88.80 this hour to outbid top competitors and test seller price flexibility. Observed asks remain clustered near 96 with some near 90, and no immediate trades occurred from my side.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of 89.00, slightly above my previous 88.8, to test seller price flexibility and maintain my competitive position in the bid queue.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I placed a bid at 89.5 to outbid my previous 89.0 and maintain top bid position amid sellers holding firm with asks near 90.5 and above. No immediate trades occurred at this level.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at 89.0 last hour; asks remain high near 96 and 90.5; no trades triggered by bids under 89.0; sellers show low ask price flexibility. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain priority but fail to pressure sellers to lower asks or trade near my bids; wide spread persists; sellers resist dropping asks below 90.5. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 89.5 this hour to test seller willingness to trade closer to 90.5 asks; maintain margin and competitive positioning; if no change by hour 15, prepare to increase bid closer to 90 to secure trades balancing profitability and timing.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases up to 89.5 have maintained top bid position but failed to induce sellers to lower their asks from around 90.5 or to trigger trades at this spread. Despite holding a competitive bid, the wide spread and seller rigidity limited trade opportunities, showing that modest bid increases alone are insufficient to close the gap near market close.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the limited time remaining, I will increase my bid closer to 90.0 to improve the likelihood of securing trades before the market closes, balancing profitability with urgency. This bid level remains below my true value of 100, preserving margin while aiming to attract sellers holding asks near 90.5. If this fails, I may need to accept trades at or slightly above 90 next time to avoid missing out entirely.",
  "bid": 90.0,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, I increased my bid to 90.0, aiming to close the gap with asks near 90.5 and secure trades before market close. The bid queue remains competitive with strong seller ask resistance at 90.5 and above.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue topped at 89.5 last hour; sellers hold firm at 90.5 asks; no trades triggered by bids below 89.5; wide bid-ask spread persists; sellers show low ask flexibility near market close. #### Thoughts: Incremental bids up to 89.5 maintained priority but failed to pressure sellers; sellers resistant to dropping asks below 90.5; time running out. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 90.0 this hour to better compete with sellers near 90.5 asks and enhance chances of trading before market close; balance between securing trades and preserving margin; if no trades triggered, consider slightly higher bids next time in similar scenarios."
