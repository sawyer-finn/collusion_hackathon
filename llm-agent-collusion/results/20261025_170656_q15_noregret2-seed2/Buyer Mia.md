# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Globe Power Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Globe Power Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.38, to position competitively in the bid queue during Hour #1.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $83.70 to outbid the closely clustered $83.5 bids and test the market's response in Hour #2.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.10 to outbid the current $84.0 cluster and test seller responsiveness to a moderate bid increase.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at $84.20, slightly above the $84.1 cluster to maintain leadership in the bid queue and continue testing the market's response.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices cluster tightly between $83.6 and $85.6 with some bids at $87.6; sellers hold firm asks around $90.67 to $97.34; no overlap between bids and asks; no trades for me yet. Other buyers have pushed bids higher but no corresponding drop in asks. #### Thoughts: Moderate bid increases maintain competitiveness without sacrificing margin, but the large bid-ask spread persists, indicating sellers' strong pricing power. Recent trades occur mostly above $85 but below $90, suggesting sellers may remain firm for now. #### Updated Strategy: Increment bid moderately to $85.7 to test seller price flexibility, maintain queue leadership, and avoid early margin erosion. Prepare to accelerate bid increases cautiously if sellers remain unresponsive or competitors push bids closer to asks.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices remain clustered around $86.00 with no trades for me; sellers' asks still high at $90.65+; competitors push bids up steadily. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $86.00 holds competitive position without overpaying; market spread remains wide, limiting trades; sellers currently hold pricing power. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $86.00 this hour to gauge seller and competitor reactions; prepare for possible bid increase next hour if sellers remain inflexible or bids rise further; balance between securing trades and preserving profit margin remains critical.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers maintain asks well above $90.5, buyers' bids cluster between $86.0-$88.75, and no trades for me so far; market spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not triggered trades; sellers hold pricing power; need to signal higher willingness to pay to induce seller movement without overbidding. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $87.0 matching some top bids to improve competitiveness and test seller flexibility; monitor resulting ask adjustments and bid queue dynamics; prepare to incrementally increase bids further if no trade occurs but maintain margin discipline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Globe Power Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.38, to position competitively in the bid queue during Hour #1.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $83.70 to outbid the closely clustered $83.5 bids and test the market's response in Hour #2.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.10 to outbid the current $84.0 cluster and test seller responsiveness to a moderate bid increase.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at $84.20, slightly above the $84.1 cluster to maintain leadership in the bid queue and continue testing the market's response.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $84.5 to maintain queue leadership and test seller response, with sellers' asks still clustered high and no trades executed for me yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $85.7, positioning just above the top bids clustered at $85.6, aiming to maintain competitiveness while sellers' asks remain significantly higher at $90.67 and above.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid to $86.00, positioning above the previous high cluster to maintain competitiveness and test seller flexibility while no trades occurred for me yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $86.00, holding steady among the top bids without triggering any trades, as sellers' asks remain significantly higher around $90.65 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased my bid to $86.50 to improve my position slightly above the $86.25 bids, aiming to provoke seller movement and secure a trade while monitoring the unchanged high sellers' asks around $90.62 and above.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $87.0 to better position myself in the queue and test market response amid persistently high seller asks around $90.6 and above, with no trades executed for me yet.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I maintained my bid at $87.0, matching the previous hour's bid to keep my position competitive. Sellers' asks remain high around $90.56 and above, with no trades executed for me yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks consistently remain above $90.5 despite bids clustering around $86.0-$88.75; no trades for me despite steady incrementing bids; large spread persists. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain pricing power; incremental bid increases haven't induced seller concessions; patience with moderate bid level needed to preserve margin. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $87.0 to maintain queue position and signal willingness to buy; avoid aggressive bid increases early to protect profitability; closely monitor market dynamics; prepare to incrementally raise bid slightly if no trades by Hour 13, but keep increases small to balance trade probability with profit preservation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Globe Power Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Globe Power Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.38, to position competitively in the bid queue during Hour #1.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $83.70 to outbid the closely clustered $83.5 bids and test the market's response in Hour #2.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.10 to outbid the current $84.0 cluster and test seller responsiveness to a moderate bid increase.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at $84.20, slightly above the $84.1 cluster to maintain leadership in the bid queue and continue testing the market's response.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $84.5 to maintain queue leadership and test seller response, with sellers' asks still clustered high and no trades executed for me yet.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $85.7, positioning just above the top bids clustered at $85.6, aiming to maintain competitiveness while sellers' asks remain significantly higher at $90.67 and above.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid to $86.00, positioning above the previous high cluster to maintain competitiveness and test seller flexibility while no trades occurred for me yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $86.00, holding steady among the top bids without triggering any trades, as sellers' asks remain significantly higher around $90.65 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased my bid to $86.50 to improve my position slightly above the $86.25 bids, aiming to provoke seller movement and secure a trade while monitoring the unchanged high sellers' asks around $90.62 and above.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $87.0 to better position myself in the queue and test market response amid persistently high seller asks around $90.6 and above, with no trades executed for me yet.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I maintained my bid at $87.0, matching the previous hour's bid to keep my position competitive. Sellers' asks remain high around $90.56 and above, with no trades executed for me yet.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I held my bid steady at $87.0, maintaining my position in the bid queue. Sellers' asks remain high above $90.5, and no trades were executed for me this hour.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I maintained my bid at $87.0, keeping a competitive position in the bid queue while sellers' asks remain significantly higher around $90.5 and above. No trades executed for me this hour.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I maintained my bid at $87.0 amid stable seller asks above $90.5 and no trades executed for me. The bid queue continues to show higher bids from other buyers, but no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain firmly above $90.5, creating a persistent wide spread; higher bids (up to $90.1) still fail to trigger trades; I have not succeeded in securing any trades despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not moved sellers; maintaining bid preserves profit margins but risks no trades; sellers have strong pricing power and there is little downward pressure on asks. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $87.0 to maintain position and preserve margins; signal buying interest without overbidding; monitor for any market shifts. Prepare to raise bid modestly in Hour 15 if no trades occur to increase likelihood of closing a deal, balancing profitability and trade success.


# Output Format

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook.

{
  "reflection": "Despite consistent bid increases from $83.50 to $87.00 over 15 hours, no trades were secured due to sellers' asks remaining well above $90.5. My bids have been competitive within the buyer queue but insufficient to close the gap with sellers' high ask prices, resulting in no realized profits.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and no trades have occurred, I will increase my bid to $89.5 to match the higher bids in the queue, aiming to finally secure a trade and generate profit before the market closes. This bid balances approaching the sellers' price floor while still maintaining a margin below my true value of $100.",
  "bid": 89.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $89.50, matching the top bids below $90.10 in the queue, attempting to break the stalemate and secure a trade before the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain high above $90.5, with no trades triggered even by bids approaching $87. Higher bids up to $90.1 exist but trades remain elusive. Wide spread persists. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases failed to close the trade gap; final hour requires bolder action to secure a trade and avoid zero profits. Raising bid to $89.5 aims to align closer with buyer competition and entice sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid significantly in final hour to $89.5 to maximize chance of trade closure while still preserving profit margin below true value $100. Accept reduced margin to avoid no trade outcome."
