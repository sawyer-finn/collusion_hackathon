# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread; the highest bid was $83.38 and the lowest ask was $96.31. I placed a bid at $83.40, slightly above the highest current bid to improve my competitive position.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains tightly clustered near $83.4-$83.5 with a new highest bid at $83.5, and asks remain above $96. I placed a bid at $83.60 to become the top bidder.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains densely packed between $83.4 and $85.0 with my bid at $85.10, making me the top bidder. Asks remain stubbornly high above $85.5 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered between $83.6 and $85.5 with my bid at $85.10 previously, and asks remain high starting at $90.68. I placed a bid at $85.60 to become the top bidder.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly packed in low $80s to mid $85s; asks have started to show some lower offers around $90 but still far from bids; no trades at my bid levels. #### Thoughts: Sellers are reluctant to drop asks below $90, keeping the spread wide; buyers are incrementally raising bids but cautious; I must balance between bidding high enough to secure trades and maintaining profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.60 to assert stronger buying interest and potentially induce sellers to reduce asks, while preserving a profitable margin from my true value of $100.

Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread; the highest bid was $83.38 and the lowest ask was $96.31. I placed a bid at $83.40, slightly above the highest current bid to improve my competitive position.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains tightly clustered near $83.4-$83.5 with a new highest bid at $83.5, and asks remain above $96. I placed a bid at $83.60 to become the top bidder.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains densely packed between $83.4 and $85.0 with my bid at $85.10, making me the top bidder. Asks remain stubbornly high above $85.5 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered between $83.6 and $85.5 with my bid at $85.10 previously, and asks remain high starting at $90.68. I placed a bid at $85.60 to become the top bidder.
Hour 5: Hour #5 sees the bid queue still clustered around mid $80s with my bid at $85.60, remaining the top bid among several buyers. Asks remain stubbornly high, starting at $90.67, so no trades have executed at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with my bid at $85.60, remaining among the top bids, while asks are still stubbornly above $90, with no trades at my bid level. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains densely clustered around $85.6 with my bid at this level; sellers maintain ask prices above $90 with no reduction; no trades executed at my bid level. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not signaling willingness to lower asks closer to buyers' bids; maintaining bid level preserves margin and readiness to capitalize if asks drop. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $85.60 to remain top bidder, avoid aggressive price increases to protect profitability; monitor ask price movement closely for future tactical adjustments.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue continues to cluster between $85.6 and $87.7; asks stubbornly remain above $90, no trades at my bid level; other buyers bidding higher than me but no trades clearing near my bid. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yet willing to lower ask prices close to bids; holding steady preserves profit margin; my bid is competitive but not the highest, potentially reducing chance of immediate trade. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.60 to keep position; avoid bid increases until ask prices drop or time pressure mounts; watch for any price movements indicating market may clear soon; prepare to increment bid cautiously in response to changes in ask prices or nearing final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid cluster has shifted slightly higher with top bids reaching $88.2; ask prices remain unchanged above $90, maintaining a wide spread. No trades involving my bid. #### Thoughts: The market is still slow to converge, with sellers firm on ask prices and buyers pushing bids up gradually. Maintaining a conservative bid protects margins but risks missing trades as time dwindles. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at $85.60 for now to preserve profitability and observe market dynamics; prepare to incrementally increase bid near hour 12-13 if ask prices remain high; avoid early aggressive bidding to sustain profit potential while balancing the urgency to secure trades later.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread; the highest bid was $83.38 and the lowest ask was $96.31. I placed a bid at $83.40, slightly above the highest current bid to improve my competitive position.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains tightly clustered near $83.4-$83.5 with a new highest bid at $83.5, and asks remain above $96. I placed a bid at $83.60 to become the top bidder.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains densely packed between $83.4 and $85.0 with my bid at $85.10, making me the top bidder. Asks remain stubbornly high above $85.5 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered between $83.6 and $85.5 with my bid at $85.10 previously, and asks remain high starting at $90.68. I placed a bid at $85.60 to become the top bidder.
Hour 5: Hour #5 sees the bid queue still clustered around mid $80s with my bid at $85.60, remaining the top bid among several buyers. Asks remain stubbornly high, starting at $90.67, so no trades have executed at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with my bid at $85.60, remaining among the top bids, while asks are still stubbornly above $90, with no trades at my bid level. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my position.
Hour 7: Hour 7 market shows bid queue slightly more competitive with top bids just above $85.6; ask queue remains above $90. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my top bidder status.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, the bid queue remains competitive with several buyers bidding above $85.6; ask prices remain high above $90. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my top bidder status.
Hour 9: Hour 9 bid queue shows multiple top bids above $85.6 with the highest at $87.7; ask prices remain stubbornly above $90. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my competitive position.
Hour 10: Hour 10 begins with the highest bids clustered between $85.6 and $88.2, with no change in ask prices above $90. I maintain my bid at $85.60 to stay competitive without overbidding aggressively.
Hour 11: Hour #11 sees bid queue with top bids up to $88.5 and ask prices still stubbornly above $90. I maintain my bid at $85.60 to stay competitive without overbidding.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, the bid queue shows top bids rising to $88.75, with my bid now at $87.00, placing me more competitively but still below the top tier; ask prices remain steady above $90 with no trade executions.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster continues to rise toward $89; sellers keep ask prices stubbornly above $90; no trades at my bid level yet. #### Thoughts: Market demand is increasing, but sellers remain firm; maintaining low bids risks missing trades as time limits near. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $87.00 to improve competitive position while preserving margin, preparing to raise bids further in the final hours if asks do not drop.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #13. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids now at $90.0; ask prices remain above $90. No trades at my bid of $87.0 last hour. #### Thoughts: Market demand continues to strengthen; sellers remain firm but bids are closing the gap. Maintaining bids too low risks no trades; aggressive bidding may be needed soon. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $88.5 to approach top tier and improve chances of trade before final two hours. Prepare to increase bids toward $90 if no trades occur in hour 14.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered between $83.6 and $85.5 with my bid at $85.10 previously, and asks remain high starting at $90.68. I placed a bid at $85.60 to become the top bidder.
Hour 5: Hour #5 sees the bid queue still clustered around mid $80s with my bid at $85.60, remaining the top bid among several buyers. Asks remain stubbornly high, starting at $90.67, so no trades have executed at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with my bid at $85.60, remaining among the top bids, while asks are still stubbornly above $90, with no trades at my bid level. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my position.
Hour 7: Hour 7 market shows bid queue slightly more competitive with top bids just above $85.6; ask queue remains above $90. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my top bidder status.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, the bid queue remains competitive with several buyers bidding above $85.6; ask prices remain high above $90. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my top bidder status.
Hour 9: Hour 9 bid queue shows multiple top bids above $85.6 with the highest at $87.7; ask prices remain stubbornly above $90. I placed a bid at $85.60 to maintain my competitive position.
Hour 10: Hour 10 begins with the highest bids clustered between $85.6 and $88.2, with no change in ask prices above $90. I maintain my bid at $85.60 to stay competitive without overbidding aggressively.
Hour 11: Hour #11 sees bid queue with top bids up to $88.5 and ask prices still stubbornly above $90. I maintain my bid at $85.60 to stay competitive without overbidding.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, the bid queue shows top bids rising to $88.75, with my bid now at $87.00, placing me more competitively but still below the top tier; ask prices remain steady above $90 with no trade executions.
Hour 13: Hour #13 shows bids rising to $90.0 with my bid increased to $88.5, placing me closer to the top bidders; ask prices remain stubbornly above $90 with no trades at my bid level.
Hour 14: At Hour #14, bids have increased with several buyers clustered around $89.0 to $90.1; asks remain high above $90. I placed a bid at $89.00 to improve my competitive position among the top bidders.

{
  "reflection": "Despite steadily increasing my bids from $83.40 to $89.00 over the past hours to become a top contender, I have yet to secure any trades. The ask prices have persistently remained above $90, limiting my ability to transact without sacrificing margin.
