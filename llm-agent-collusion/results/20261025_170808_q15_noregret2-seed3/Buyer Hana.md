# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Watch for any downward movement in asks, especially near $89.5, to adjust bids more aggressively and secure trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids clustered in the low 80s and asks near the high 90s; I placed a bid at $83.60, slightly above the highest existing bid to position competitively.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue tightened with highest bids at $84.0, and the ask queue remains clustered near $96.3, except one seller at $94. I placed a bid at $84.05, just above the highest bid to stay competitive.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the highest bid cluster remains around $84.1 to $84.35, and asks stay mostly high near $96, except a lone low ask at $89.5 by Seller Omar. I placed a bid at $84.40, just above the previous highest bid.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows stable bid clusters with my bid placed at $84.46, just above the highest bid. Asks remain significantly higher, mostly around $93.7 and above, with some lower asks near $89.5 persisting.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids clustered in the low 80s and asks near the high 90s; I placed a bid at $83.60, slightly above the highest existing bid to position competitively.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue tightened with highest bids at $84.0, and the ask queue remains clustered near $96.3, except one seller at $94. I placed a bid at $84.05, just above the highest bid to stay competitive.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the highest bid cluster remains around $84.1 to $84.35, and asks stay mostly high near $96, except a lone low ask at $89.5 by Seller Omar. I placed a bid at $84.40, just above the previous highest bid.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows stable bid clusters with my bid placed at $84.46, just above the highest bid. Asks remain significantly higher, mostly around $93.7 and above, with some lower asks near $89.5 persisting.
Hour 5: Hour 5 shows bids tightly clustered around $84.0-$84.5, with my bid at $84.46 among the top. Asks remain high with a few at $89.44, indicating no immediate price convergence.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids remain clustered just above $84.4 with some buyers at $84.5 and above; asks persist mostly around $89.4 and above, with one outlier at $80.5 from Seller Nia. I placed a bid at $84.55, slightly above the current highest bids.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $84.25-$84.5+; asks steady high near $89.4 with one very low ask at $80.5; no trade involving me so far; spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Sellers still reluctant to lower asks; isolated low asks may pressure prices down eventually; buyers slowly increase bids but far from true value $100. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $84.55 to stay competitive and signal willingness to trade; watch for ask movement closer to $89 or below; prepare to raise bids further if spread narrows or to secure trades without sacrificing too much margin.


# Output Format

I have not capitalized on the few low ask outliers, possibly due to conservative bid increments.",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $84.35-$84.6; ask prices stable $89.38-$93.23 with no downward movement; spread remains wide; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering asks; increasing bids beyond $84.60 now risks margin without guaranteed trades; maintaining bid stability may encourage sellers to test lower asks. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $84.60 to keep competitive edge; monitor ask responses closely; prepare to increase bid moderately if no trade by Hour 10 to avoid last-minute rush; avoid aggressive bids near true value early to conserve profit margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, the highest bid cluster remains around $84.1 to $84.35, and asks stay mostly high near $96, except a lone low ask at $89.5 by Seller Omar. I placed a bid at $84.40, just above the previous highest bid.

Hour 7: In Hour 7, bid queue remained tightly clustered around $84.35 to $84.55 with my bid set at $84.60, maintaining the top position. Ask queue stayed stable near $89.39 to $93.23 with no significant decrease. No trades involving me yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue steady around 84.0-84.7 with my bid at 84.60; ask prices stable near 89.37-93.23; no trades for me yet and no ask price drops. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm; increasing bid now risks margin without guaranteed trades; maintaining current bid keeps me competitive and preserves profit. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 84.60 this hour to maintain top position; closely monitor ask queue and competitor bids; prepare to incrementally raise bid after Hour 11 if no trade occurs to avoid endgame rush; avoid aggressive bids close to true value early on.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Market Rules

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue competitive with top bids near 85.0 to 85.35; ask queue stable with no price reduction or trade activity involving me; large bid-ask spread persists. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain leading position but ask prices remain too high for trades; sellers are firm, indicating low willingness to lower asks; timing and balance between margin and securing trades critical given limited remaining hours. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.05 to keep highest buyer position; await any sign of ask price movement or trade activity; prepare to increment bid more aggressively in Hour 14 if no trades occur, aiming to close spread while protecting profit margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highly competitive with top bids near 85.0 to 85.25; ask queue unchanged and firm around 89.12 to 93.23; no trades involving me despite leading bids; bid-ask spread remains large. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintained top position but have not triggered seller price reductions or trades; sellers' firm ask prices create a persistent spread; urgency growing with only one hour left. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid more aggressively to 85.25 to signal stronger buying interest and reduce spread; continue to protect profit margin while aiming to induce a trade before time runs out; prepare to assess final hour for possible further bid adjustment.
