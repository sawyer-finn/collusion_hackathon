# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mira. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Your name is Buyer Mira. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue showed a highest bid of $84.35 and asks remained high near $93.99, with no trades. I placed a bid at $84.40 to maintain competitiveness and attempt to push the market towards trade.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue highest bid is $84.45 and the ask queue remains high with the lowest asks around $89.45 to $93.74. I placed a bid at $84.50 to maintain a leading position and test seller response.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid steady at $84.50 with multiple buyers; seller asks remain high above $89.43; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain resistant to lowering prices; buyer bids clustered with little upward movement; incremental bids insufficient to close spread. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain current bid at $84.50 to keep leading position; hold off on withdrawing bid; prepare to increase bid more aggressively in coming hours if no trade occurs to balance profitability and securing trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids cluster $84.50-$84.60; sellers maintain asks above $89.38; no trades for us yet despite leading bids. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have preserved competitiveness but failed to bridge the gap or induce trades; sellers seem resistant to moderate bid increases. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above $84.60 to $84.65 to assert stronger buyer interest; aim to push sellers to reconsider ask prices or enable trade while balancing profit margin preservation.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue showed a highest bid of $84.35 and asks remained high near $93.99, with no trades. I placed a bid at $84.40 to maintain competitiveness and attempt to push the market towards trade.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue highest bid is $84.45 and the ask queue remains high with the lowest asks around $89.45 to $93.74. I placed a bid at $84.50 to maintain a leading position and test seller response.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the highest bid remains at $84.50, matched by several buyers including myself, while seller asks continue to hold above $89.44. I placed a bid at $84.50 to maintain my competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue shows several buyers clustered at $84.50 and asks remain firm above $89.43, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $84.50 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains competitive with multiple buyers around $84.50-$84.55; the lowest ask is still high at $89.39. I placed a bid at $84.60 to gain a leading position and test seller responsiveness.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, bids cluster tightly around $84.50-$84.60, with sellers holding asks above $89.38 and no trades for us yet. I placed a bid at $84.65 to lead the bid queue and probe seller responsiveness.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, bid queue highest bids clustered near $84.65 with sellers holding firm asks above $89.37; I placed a bid at $84.70 to strengthen my competitive position while seeking to push market towards trade.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids cluster near $84.7; lowest asks steady above $89.37; no trades for us yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear firm and unyielding; incremental bid increases have not triggered lower asks or trades; wide spread remains a barrier. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.70 to preserve position and margin; monitor for any seller ask adjustments or bid queue changes; prepare to reconsider bid value if market dynamics shift or as final hours approach.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids cluster near $84.7-$85.0; seller asks remain firm above $89.37; no trades for us yet; bid-ask spread remains wide and unchanged; no new lower asks or trades detected this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to hold firm, and incremental bid increases have not induced trades or ask drops; maintaining bid at $84.7 preserves competitive position with reasonable margin; risk of losing margin by increasing bid too much before hour 15. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $84.7 to maintain position, monitor for any shifts in ask prices or bids above $85; prepare for strategic bid adjustments as time pressure increases in final hours; avoid premature bid inflation to protect profitability.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highest bids now at $85.25, seller asks remain firm above $89.12, no trades realized, spread still large. #### Thoughts: Current bids near $84.7 have not closed the gap; sellers not yielding; incremental bid increase needed to test seller flexibility approaching final hour. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $85.10 to improve trade likelihood while maintaining margin; prepare for a possible final hour bid closer to $85.50 if sellers remain firm.

{
  "reflection": "Despite a steady increase in my bid from $83.60 to $85.10 over the hours, no trades have occurred due to the persistent spread with seller asks holding above $89.12. Maintaining bids close to $85.1 has kept me competitive but unable to close the gap. I could have tested more aggressive bids earlier to pressure sellers sooner, but preserving margin was necessary given my true value of $100.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "As this is the final hour, I must prioritize securing a trade while balancing profitability. The spread remains wide, but some buyers bid as high as $86.5. I will increase my bid to $85.6 to lead the bid queue and signal willingness to pay more, aiming to incentivize sellers to lower asks or close a trade. This move is a strategic compromise between margin and likelihood of trade.",
  "bid": 85.6,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I increased my bid to $85.6 to outbid the current highest bidders at $85.35 and $85.25, attempting to push towards a trade before the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Highest bids now cluster up to $85.6, sellers remain firm above $89.12, spread still large but narrowing. #### Thoughts: Past bids near $85.1 failed to provoke seller concessions; final hour requires bolder bid to increase chance of purchase. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $85.6 to lead the market, balancing margin and trade probability in last hour; prepared to accept moderate margin loss to secure first trade."
