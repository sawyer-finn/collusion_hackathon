# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

My previous mid-$83 bid was not competitive enough. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $84.0 to improve queue position and apply pressure on sellers. Avoid approaching asks too closely to maintain margin. Observe if sellers reduce prices or if trades start to happen. Maintain a gradual approach to closing the spread over next hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids mostly between $81.27 and $83.64 and asks between $96.27 and $98.71. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at $81.50 to remain competitive near the lower end of the bid queue.
Hour 2: Hour 2 opened with bids clustered from $81.5 to $85.0 and asks still high around $96.2 to $97.34. I increased my bid to $83.00 to become more competitive in the mid bid queue.
Hour 3: Hour #3 opened with bids clustering between $82.4 and $86.0, with my bid set at $84.0, placing me in the upper mid-range of the queue. Asks remain high around $94.5 to $96.21 with no trades yet.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with bids from $83.0 to $88.0; I placed a bid at $85.0 to improve competitiveness. Asks remain high near $94.0 to $96.18 with no trades occurring yet.

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids mostly between $81.27 and $83.64 and asks between $96.27 and $98.71. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at $81.50 to remain competitive near the lower end of the bid queue.
Hour 2: Hour 2 opened with bids clustered from $81.5 to $85.0 and asks still high around $96.2 to $97.34. I increased my bid to $83.00 to become more competitive in the mid bid queue.
Hour 3: Hour #3 opened with bids clustering between $82.4 and $86.0, with my bid set at $84.0, placing me in the upper mid-range of the queue. Asks remain high around $94.5 to $96.21 with no trades yet.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with bids from $83.0 to $88.0; I placed a bid at $85.0 to improve competitiveness. Asks remain high near $94.0 to $96.18 with no trades occurring yet.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opened with bids clustered between $83.0 and $88.25 and asks still high near $92.0 to $96.18. I placed a bid at $85.50 to improve competitiveness and probe for trades without overly compromising margin.
Hour 6: Hour #6 opened with bids ranging from $84.5 to $91.25 and asks from $91.99 to $96.18. I placed a bid at $86.25 to improve competitiveness and probe for trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster between $84.5 and $91.25; asks persist above $91.99 with no significant downward movement. Buyer Theo continues to secure trades at higher ask prices. My bids have improved but no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm, and trades occur closer to $91+; my bids should carefully inch up to improve chances without sacrificing margin. Aggressive jumps could reduce profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $86.25 to test seller acceptance around mid-$80s to low $90s. Maintain balance to maximize profit and secure trades ahead of later hours. Monitor for any drop in ask prices or trade activity to adjust bids accordingly.

{
  "reflection": "Despite gradually increasing my bid from $81.50 to $86.25 over the past six hours, I have yet to secure any trades. Sellers remain firm with asks mostly above $91.99, while Buyer Theo continues to clinch trades at prices near or above $89, indicating a willingness to pay closer to seller ask prices. My cautious incremental approach has kept margins intact but hasn't yet resulted in transactions, which risks missing out on profitable trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To improve my chances of securing trades without sacrificing too much margin, I will raise my bid slightly above my current $86.25 to $87.00. This positions me more competitively against buyers bidding up to $91.25, and closer to where trades seem to be happening, while still maintaining a reasonable buffer from my true value of $100. I will monitor trade activity closely to adjust upwards if necessary but avoid aggressive jumps that erode profitability prematurely.",

My earlier bids below $86.25 haven't yielded trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm and trades occur closer to $89-$91; increasing bid slightly could improve chances without heavily sacrificing margin. Aggressive bidding risks reduced profits. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $87.00 to better compete against higher bids and approach sellers' ask range. Monitor trade prices closely for downward movement to adjust bids accordingly. Maintain balance of competitiveness and profitability for remaining 8 hours."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids range $85.0 to $91.5; asks hold firm above $91.9; trades occur near $89-$91 but not for my current bid. Buyer Theo active around $91.9; sellers not lowering asks. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase needed to close gap to transaction prices without sacrificing margin. Sellers show no sign of lowering asks below $91.9; buyer competition strong near $90+. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $87.50 to improve queue position and probe seller willingness; observe market reactions closely; prepare to increment further only if trade prices move downward or competition intensifies; avoid aggressive bids that erode profit margin prematurely.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 9: Hour #9 opened with bids from $85.0 to $91.9; I placed a bid at $88.00 to improve competitiveness. Seller asks remain above $91.97, and no trades involved me this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids $85.0 to $91.9; my bid at $88.0 last hour; asks stable above $91.97; trades occur near $89-$91; sellers remain firm; competition high near $91.9. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not triggered trades; sellers reluctant to lower asks; buyers cluster near $91.9; cautious increases needed. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $88.50 this hour to move closer to trade price range; avoid exceeding $90 to protect margins; monitor seller behavior for any signs of weakening; prepare to increment further if no trades occur but maintain discipline to avoid overpaying.


# Output Format

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids range from $85.0 to $91.95 with top buyers clustered near $91.9+. Sellers maintain asks firmly above $91.98, and trades occur near $89-$91, but I have no successful trades yet despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no sign of lowering asks; buyer bids just below sellers' asks indicate a tight spread; incremental bid increases have not yielded trades; balancing competitiveness and margin preservation is crucial. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $90.00 to better compete near top buyers and approach sellers' ask levels without exceeding them; monitor if this bid secures trades; remain cautious about bids above $91 to avoid margin erosion; adjust strategy dynamically based on seller ask movements and time remaining.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now range from $87.0 to $91.97, with top buyers clustered near $91.90+. Sellers consistently maintain asks above $91.98, keeping the spread tight and trades limited to buyers bidding near $91.9 or above. I have yet to secure trades despite incremental bid increases.
#### Thoughts: The spread is tight and sellers are firm, so bidding just below the lowest ask near $91.98 may improve trade prospects without sacrificing too much margin. Other buyers bidding at or near $91.90 signal strong competition.
#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.50 to approach sellers’ ask range and compete with top buyers, while maintaining a buffer below $91.98 to preserve margin. Monitor market reaction closely and be ready to adjust bids in the final hours to balance securing trades and maximizing profit.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered $90.5 to $91.95, sellers firm at $91.97+.

Market shows strong buyer competition and sellers reluctant to lower asks below $91.97. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.90 to compete directly below lowest asks, aiming to trade before final hour.
