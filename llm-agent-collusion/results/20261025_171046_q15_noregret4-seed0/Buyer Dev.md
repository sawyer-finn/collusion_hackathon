# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed bid at $83.75, slightly above highest existing buyer bid of $83.7 to lead the bid queue. Initial market shows a wide bid-ask spread with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Hour 2 saw the bid queue remain competitive with bids clustering around $83.7-$84.0, and I increased my bid slightly to $83.85 to maintain the lead among buyers. Asks remain high with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 3: Hour 3 shows a competitive bid landscape clustered just above $83.85 with top bids around $84.05, and sellers holding asks mostly above $84.99. I raised my bid to $84.06 to maintain the lead and test seller price responsiveness.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.76, leading the bid queue by a small margin. Bid queue remains clustered around $83.75 to $84.75, sellers hold asks mostly above $84.99 with no trades this hour.

Hour 3: Hour 3 shows a competitive bid landscape clustered just above $83.85 with top bids around $84.05, and sellers holding asks mostly above $84.99. I raised my bid to $84.06 to maintain the lead and test seller price responsiveness.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.76, leading the bid queue by a small margin. Bid queue remains clustered around $83.75 to $84.75, sellers hold asks mostly above $84.99 with no trades this hour.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue is competitive with top bids reaching 84.9, and asks remain mostly above 84.99. I placed a bid at 84.91 to lead the buyers and attempt to narrow the gap with sellers.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows the bid queue remains highly competitive with top bids clustered between 84.2 and 84.95, and sellers holding asks mostly above 84.97. I placed a bid at $84.92 to stay at the front of the queue and attempt to narrow the bid-ask spread.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids remain tightly clustered around 84.85-84.95, sellers hold asks mostly above 84.97 with no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain buyer leadership but sellers are still not yielding. The spread remains wide, making trades unlikely at current prices. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally above highest buyer bid to 84.92 to signal willingness to trade and pressure sellers to lower asks or initiate trades. Monitor closely for any reduction in seller prices or trade executions to reassess aggressiveness next hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids cluster near $84.9-$85.0; seller asks remain firm above $87.25; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the bid at $84.92 preserves profit margin but does not close the bid-ask spread; sellers remain unresponsive to buyer pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $84.92 to maintain buyer leadership and avoid margin erosion; stay alert for any shift in seller ask prices or buyer competition; prepare to increase bid more aggressively if sellers start lowering asks or if approaching final hours without trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed bid at $83.75, slightly above highest existing buyer bid of $83.7 to lead the bid queue. Initial market shows a wide bid-ask spread with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Hour 2 saw the bid queue remain competitive with bids clustering around $83.7-$84.0, and I increased my bid slightly to $83.85 to maintain the lead among buyers. Asks remain high with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 3: Hour 3 shows a competitive bid landscape clustered just above $83.85 with top bids around $84.05, and sellers holding asks mostly above $84.99. I raised my bid to $84.06 to maintain the lead and test seller price responsiveness.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.76, leading the bid queue by a small margin. Bid queue remains clustered around $83.75 to $84.75, sellers hold asks mostly above $84.99 with no trades this hour.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue is competitive with top bids reaching 84.9, and asks remain mostly above 84.99. I placed a bid at 84.91 to lead the buyers and attempt to narrow the gap with sellers.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows the bid queue remains highly competitive with top bids clustered between 84.2 and 84.95, and sellers holding asks mostly above 84.97. I placed a bid at $84.92 to stay at the front of the queue and attempt to narrow the bid-ask spread.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, buyer bids remain tightly clustered near $84.9, sellers continue to hold asks well above $87.4, and no trades occurred. I placed a bid at $84.92 to maintain buyer leadership and test seller responsiveness.
Hour 8: Hour 8 saw stable buyer bids clustered just below $85, with my bid at $84.92 maintaining the lead. Seller asks remain significantly higher, mostly above $87.25, and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 9: For Hour 9, I placed a bid at $84.92 maintaining the lead among buyers, while seller asks remain elevated above $87.24 with no trades occurring.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, bids cluster just above $84.92, with the highest buyer bids at $85.04. Seller asks remain elevated above $87.05. I placed a bid at $85.05 to lead the buyer queue and test seller reaction.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top buyer bids now cluster between $84.9 and $85.04, sellers hold firm asks above $87.05, no trade for me yet. #### Thoughts: My previous bid at $84.92 was insufficient to lead buyers or close the bid-ask spread; sellers remain unyielding on ask prices; buyers are more aggressive, bidding above $85.0. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.05 to lead buyers and improve trade chances; maintain margin discipline but prepare to escalate bids incrementally if sellers do not lower asks in coming hours; closely monitor seller ask prices for any downtrend or trade opportunities; balance between profitability and securing trades as we approach final hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids are clustered tightly between $84.99 and $85.05, with my bid matching the highest in the queue; sellers continue to hold asks firmly above $87.04, preventing trades; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $85.05 keeps me competitive among buyers but sellers remain unyielding; gap between bid and asks is still large; patience needed but readiness to increment bids is critical as final hours approach. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.05 this hour to maintain buyer leadership; monitor seller ask prices closely for any decline; if sellers do not lower asks, prepare to increase bids in small increments in coming hours to increase trade chances while balancing profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #12. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 9: For Hour 9, I placed a bid at $84.92 maintaining the lead among buyers, while seller asks remain elevated above $87.24 with no trades occurring.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, bids cluster just above $84.92, with the highest buyer bids at $85.04. Seller asks remain elevated above $87.05. I placed a bid at $85.05 to lead the buyer queue and test seller reaction.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid at $85.05, maintaining the lead among buyer bids clustered between $84.99 and $85.05; seller asks remain high, mostly above $87.04, resulting in no trades for me this hour.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 13: You bought from Seller Eli at $85.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids tightly clustered between $85.00 and $85.07 previously; sellers hold asks steadily above $86.25 with no downward movement; no trades made so far despite bid increases.
#### Thoughts: Sellers remain confident holding high asks; incremental bid increases needed to probe seller willingness; leadership in bid queue essential to influence seller behavior.
#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $85.10 to maintain lead and test seller price flexibility; prepare to raise bids further in small increments in final hours if asks remain high; balance between maintaining profit margin and securing trades is key with only 2 hours remaining.

{
  "reflection": "In the previous hours, maintaining a bid around $85.10 kept me near the front of the buyer queue but did not push sellers to lower their ask prices, which remain stubbornly high above $86.25.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 13: You bought from Seller Eli at $85.0
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Eli at $85.02





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain clustered around $85.00-$85.10; sellers hold firm asks above $86.25 without concession; no trades except Hour 13 purchase at $85.0. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain confident; incremental bid increases have not induced ask price drops; leadership is maintained but bid-ask spread persists. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.15 to test seller flexibility; prepare for possible larger bid increase in final hour if sellers remain rigid; balance need for trades against profit margin preservation given limited time horizon.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases have secured two trades at around $85.00-$85.02 but sellers have not shown flexibility below $86.25 ask prices. Maintaining leadership on bids around $85.10-$85.15 has preserved profit margins but failed to close the bid-ask gap. Sellers appear confident, keeping ask prices high despite buyer pressure.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will increase my bid more aggressively to $85.20 to attempt closing the spread and securing a final trade. The bid remains below my true value of $100, preserving profitability, but signals seriousness to sellers to induce a price concession or a trade. If no trade occurs, I avoid pushing bids too close to asks, protecting profit margins.",
  "bid": 85.2,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid at $85.20 to lead the buyers and test seller willingness to lower asks in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Buyer bids remain clustered around $85.00-$85.10; sellers hold firm asks above $86.25 without concession; two recent trades secured near $85.0; sellers remain firm. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain leadership but have not induced ask price drops; sellers confident holding higher asks; limited time left demands a stronger bid to secure final trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.20 this final hour to test seller flexibility and attempt to close spread; balance between securing trades and maintaining profit margin; avoid overbidding beyond $85.20 given persistent high ask prices."
