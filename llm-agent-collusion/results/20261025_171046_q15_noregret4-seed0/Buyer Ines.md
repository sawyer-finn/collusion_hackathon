# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.7 to improve chances of execution while still maintaining a wide margin from the lowest ask around $96.43.
Hour 2: Hour 2 shows the bid queue tightening at the top around $84.0 and asks still high mostly above $96, except some low asks at $85 and below. I placed a bid at $84.10 to stay competitive just above the highest bids.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.25, aiming to improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.50 to outbid the highest bids near $84.6 and improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.

#### Observations: Bids remain clustered around $84.15-$84.8 with sellers holding lowest asks at $84.99; no trades on my bids yet. Recent trades near $85 indicate sellers' willingness to transact at this price point but reluctance to go lower. #### Thoughts: Matching the lowest ask at $84.99 should improve execution chances compared to previous bids slightly below $84.99.

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.7 to improve chances of execution while still maintaining a wide margin from the lowest ask around $96.43.
Hour 2: Hour 2 shows the bid queue tightening at the top around $84.0 and asks still high mostly above $96, except some low asks at $85 and below. I placed a bid at $84.10 to stay competitive just above the highest bids.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.25, aiming to improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.50 to outbid the highest bids near $84.6 and improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at $84.99 this hour, matching the lowest asks currently at $84.99 from Sellers Ilan and Gus, aiming to improve execution chances while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $84.99 to match the lowest asks from Sellers Gus and Eli and stay competitive among buyers bidding up to $84.95.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Maya at $84.94





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers cluster bids around $84.85-$84.95, and lowest asks remain near $84.97-$84.99. Recent trades occurred near $85, confirming this is a key price level. #### Thoughts: Matching the lowest ask at $84.99 keeps us competitive and improves chances of execution while maintaining margin. Incremental bid increases beyond $84.99 should be cautious to preserve profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $84.99 this hour to compete directly with lowest asks and buyers near $84.95. If no trade occurs next hour, consider small increases towards $85.10 as time pressure mounts, balancing margin and trade probability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.7 to improve chances of execution while still maintaining a wide margin from the lowest ask around $96.43.
Hour 2: Hour 2 shows the bid queue tightening at the top around $84.0 and asks still high mostly above $96, except some low asks at $85 and below. I placed a bid at $84.10 to stay competitive just above the highest bids.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.25, aiming to improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.50 to outbid the highest bids near $84.6 and improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at $84.99 this hour, matching the lowest asks currently at $84.99 from Sellers Ilan and Gus, aiming to improve execution chances while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $84.99 to match the lowest asks from Sellers Gus and Eli and stay competitive among buyers bidding up to $84.95.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below $85, and the lowest asks still hover near $87.5 and above, indicating sellers have not dropped prices yet. I placed a bid at $84.99 to remain competitive with other buyers.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, bid queue remains tightly clustered between $84.92 and $85.0, with multiple buyers at $84.99 and $85.0. Lowest asks remain significantly above bids, mostly above $87.25. I placed a bid at $85.05 to outbid the current highest bids and improve execution chances.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Maya at $84.94
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.01





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at $84.92-$85.0; several buyers at $84.99 and $85.0; asks remain high mostly above $87.25, indicating seller resistance. Recent trades settled near $84.94-$85.0 confirm this as a focal price. #### Thoughts: Bids at $84.99-$85.0 are competitive but have not led to increased trade volume due to ask prices staying elevated. Slightly increasing bid above $85.0 could enhance likelihood of execution and signal buyer strength. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $85.05 to outbid current top bids and position for potential trades if sellers lower ask prices or buyer demand pushes market upwards. Monitor ask queue for any downward movement or new low asks. Adjust bids incrementally towards $85.10 if no trade occurs in next hour to balance margin and execution speed.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "By maintaining bids just below $85.05 previously, I secured trades near $85.0 but missed opportunities to push prices down further due to seller resistance above $87. The tight bid cluster suggests strong buyer competition but limited seller willingness to lower asks. Incrementally increasing bids has helped with execution, but I need to be mindful of not overpaying too early in the limited time horizon.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To improve execution chances without sacrificing margin, I will increase my bid slightly above the current highest bid of $85.03 to $85.07. This will position me as the top buyer, potentially attracting sellers to lower their ask prices or triggering trades with existing lower asks. I will monitor the ask queue carefully for any new downward movement and be ready to adjust bids closer to $85.10 if no trades occur next hour, balancing the urgency of execution with profit preservation.",
  "bid": 85.07,

Recent trades have hovered near $85.0. #### Thoughts: Slightly outbidding top buyers can improve my position in the queue and signal stronger buyer intent, potentially encouraging sellers to lower asks or triggering trades with existing low asks like $85.5. Incremental increases are necessary to balance margin and execution likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.07 this hour to become top buyer; monitor asks closely for downward movement; if no trade occurs, consider incremental increase towards $85.10 next hour to maintain competitiveness while managing profitability."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Maya at $84.94
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.01
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Maya at $84.98





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids at $85.01 to $85.03; lowest asks still well above bids at $85.5 and higher, showing seller resistance. Recent trades have hovered near $85.0. #### Thoughts: Slightly outbidding top buyers can improve my position in the queue and signal stronger buyer intent, potentially encouraging sellers to lower asks or triggering trades with existing low asks like $85.5. Incremental increases are necessary to balance margin and execution likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.07 this hour to become top buyer; monitor asks closely for downward movement; if no trade occurs, consider incremental increase towards $85.10 next hour to maintain competitiveness while managing profitability.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #10. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid at $85.07 to outbid the current highest bids clustered around $85.03 and $85.05, aiming to enhance trade execution opportunities.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids near $85.04. Lowest asks remain significantly above bids near $87.1 and higher. I placed a bid at $85.08 to outbid the current top bids and improve execution chances.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids at $85.01 to $85.04; lowest asks still well above bids at $87.1 and higher, showing seller resistance. Recent trades hover near $85.0, but no trades occurred at higher bids. #### Thoughts: Slightly outbidding top buyers can improve my position and signal stronger buyer intent, potentially encouraging sellers to lower asks or triggering trades with existing low asks. Incremental increases balance margin and execution likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.08 this hour to become top buyer; monitor asks for downward movement or trade triggers; if no trade, consider incremental increase towards $85.10 next hour to maintain competitiveness while managing profitability.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids near $85.05; lowest asks remain high above $87, showing seller resistance. Recent trades consistently near $85.0 with no upward price movement. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep me competitive but have not yet induced sellers to lower asks. Slightly stronger bids might signal serious buyer intent and encourage price concessions. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.09 this hour to maintain top buyer spot and monitor for seller response or trade triggers. If no improvement in next hour, consider further small increments towards $85.10 to balance profitability and execution likelihood.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.7 to improve chances of execution while still maintaining a wide margin from the lowest ask around $96.43.
Hour 2: Hour 2 shows the bid queue tightening at the top around $84.0 and asks still high mostly above $96, except some low asks at $85 and below. I placed a bid at $84.10 to stay competitive just above the highest bids.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.25, aiming to improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 4: Placed bid at $84.50 to outbid the highest bids near $84.6 and improve chances of execution while maintaining a reasonable margin.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at $84.99 this hour, matching the lowest asks currently at $84.99 from Sellers Ilan and Gus, aiming to improve execution chances while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $84.99 to match the lowest asks from Sellers Gus and Eli and stay competitive among buyers bidding up to $84.95.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below $85, and the lowest asks still hover near $87.5 and above, indicating sellers have not dropped prices yet. I placed a bid at $84.99 to remain competitive with other buyers.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, bid queue remains tightly clustered between $84.92 and $85.0, with multiple buyers at $84.99 and $85.0. Lowest asks remain significantly above bids, mostly above $87.25. I placed a bid at $85.05 to outbid the current highest bids and improve execution chances.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid at $85.07 to outbid the current highest bids clustered around $85.03 and $85.05, aiming to enhance trade execution opportunities.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids near $85.04. Lowest asks remain significantly above bids near $87.1 and higher. I placed a bid at $85.08 to outbid the current top bids and improve execution chances.
Hour 11: Placed a bid at $85.09 to outbid current highest bids and observe market response; no immediate trade occurred, and lowest asks remain above $87.
Hour 12: Hour 12 shows bid queue tightly clustered near $85.06 with no sellers lowering asks below $86.5. I placed a bid at $85.10 to maintain top buyer position and test seller response.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids near $85.06; lowest asks remain high above $86.5, indicating seller resistance. Recent trades consistently near $85.0 with no upward price movement. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness and may signal serious buyer intent. Sellers have not dropped ask prices despite active bidding. Slightly stronger bids might encourage seller concessions or trigger trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.10 this hour to maintain top buyer spot and monitor for seller response or trade triggers. If no improvement by Hour 13, consider further small increments towards $85.15, balancing profitability and execution likelihood.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids near $85.06 and asks stubbornly above $86.5. Recent trades consistently near $85.0 indicate stable buyer interest but seller resistance at higher ask prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness and show buyer commitment; sellers have not dropped asks, so stronger bids may be needed to push prices or trigger trades. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.10 this hour to hold top position and observe seller behavior. If no improvement next hour, increase bid to $85.15 to balance margin and execution chances, signaling stronger buyer intent to encourage seller concessions.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered just above $85.0 with top bids near $85.09. Sellers remain firm with asks above $85.10, showing reluctance to lower prices. Past trades cluster near $85.0, indicating stable buyer interest but seller resistance. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have maintained top buyer position but have not yet induced sellers to reduce asks. Holding at $85.10 keeps us competitive without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.10 this hour to hold top position and test seller willingness. If no downward movement in asks next hour, increase bid to $85.15 to signal stronger buyer commitment and encourage seller concessions.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining the bid at $85.10 over the last few hours has kept me consistently in the top buyer positions, ensuring competitive standing and steady purchases near $85.0. However, sellers have not lowered their asks below $85.10, indicating strong seller resistance and limited price concessions despite my incremental bidding. This cautious approach balanced margin preservation with trade execution but may have left some profit potential untapped.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final trading hour, I will increase my bid slightly to $85.15 to signal stronger buying intent and potentially induce sellers to lower their asks or accept trades close to this price. This small increase is still well below my true value of $100, preserving profitability while maximizing the chance of final trades.",
  "bid": 85.15,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a bid at $85.15, slightly above previous bids to attempt to prompt seller movement or secure trades before market close.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue still tightly clustered just above $85.0 with sellers holding firm above $85.10, showing reluctance to drop. Past incremental bids have not pushed asks lower. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.10 kept top buyer status but no seller concession. Slight bid increase may pressure sellers without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.15 this final hour to signal urgency and encourage trades or ask reductions, aiming to maximize profitability before market closes."
