# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

- Gradually increase bids in small increments, staying below true value (100).

- Avoid bidding too close to ask prices early on to maintain profitability buffer.
- Be ready to adjust strategy if spread narrows or trades start to occur.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.00. The bid queue has bids ranging from 81.3 to 83.7 and asks start at 96.43, indicating a large spread with no immediate trades.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered with the highest bids around 84.00 and asks still significantly higher, mostly above 85. Our bid was increased to 83.00 to improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows competing bids clustered between 83.0 and 84.5 with sellers' asks still high starting at 84.99. I placed a bid of 83.75 to improve market position amid the persistent large spread and no trades this hour.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue showed my bid at 83.75. The ask queue remains high starting at 84.99 with no trades occurring. I increased my bid to 84.90 to improve competitiveness.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.00. The bid queue has bids ranging from 81.3 to 83.7 and asks start at 96.43, indicating a large spread with no immediate trades.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered with the highest bids around 84.00 and asks still significantly higher, mostly above 85. Our bid was increased to 83.00 to improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows competing bids clustered between 83.0 and 84.5 with sellers' asks still high starting at 84.99. I placed a bid of 83.75 to improve market position amid the persistent large spread and no trades this hour.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue showed my bid at 83.75. The ask queue remains high starting at 84.99 with no trades occurring. I increased my bid to 84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows highly competitive bids clustered between 84.15 and 84.9, with my bid at the top at 84.9. The ask queue remains largely above 84.99. No trades were reported this hour.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 84.90, the top bid but just below the lowest asks at 84.97 and 84.99. No trades occurred this hour, and the large spread persists.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue is tightly clustered near 84.9 with my bid at the top; asks stubbornly start at 84.97 and 84.99; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Market clearing price likely around 85.0; sellers holding firm; no immediate price pressure downward on asks; maintaining bid just below ask to encourage trades while preserving margin. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 84.90 to remain top buyer and encourage trade execution at a profitable level; monitor next hour for ask reductions or trades to revise bid accordingly.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.00. The bid queue has bids ranging from 81.3 to 83.7 and asks start at 96.43, indicating a large spread with no immediate trades.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered with the highest bids around 84.00 and asks still significantly higher, mostly above 85. Our bid was increased to 83.00 to improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows competing bids clustered between 83.0 and 84.5 with sellers' asks still high starting at 84.99. I placed a bid of 83.75 to improve market position amid the persistent large spread and no trades this hour.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue showed my bid at 83.75. The ask queue remains high starting at 84.99 with no trades occurring. I increased my bid to 84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows highly competitive bids clustered between 84.15 and 84.9, with my bid at the top at 84.9. The ask queue remains largely above 84.99. No trades were reported this hour.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 84.90, the top bid but just below the lowest asks at 84.97 and 84.99. No trades occurred this hour, and the large spread persists.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid now at 84.95, still just below the lowest asks starting at 84.96. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I placed a bid of 84.96, slightly increasing from 84.95. The bid queue remains tightly clustered just below the lowest asks, which still start at 84.96. No trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered just below asks; my bid raised to 84.96 to approach lowest ask; asks remain firm at and above 84.96; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers' ask prices show strong reluctance to drop; marginal bid increase may push sellers or trigger a trade; competitors also bidding near lowest ask. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid close to lowest ask to balance profitability and trade execution; prepare to increase bid more aggressively in upcoming hours if no trades occur to secure trades before Hour #15; monitor sellers for any ask price reductions.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered below lowest asks; sellers hold firm at 85.5 and above; no trades so far despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers unwilling to reduce ask prices below 85.5; marginal bid increases have not yet secured trades; competitors also bidding near ask prices. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid above lowest asks to break the price barrier and secure trades; monitor trade outcomes closely; prepare for more substantial bid increases if no trade occurs this hour to secure trades before Hour #15.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows competing bids clustered between 83.0 and 84.5 with sellers' asks still high starting at 84.99. I placed a bid of 83.75 to improve market position amid the persistent large spread and no trades this hour.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue showed my bid at 83.75. The ask queue remains high starting at 84.99 with no trades occurring. I increased my bid to 84.90 to improve competitiveness.

Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 84.90, the top bid but just below the lowest asks at 84.97 and 84.99. No trades occurred this hour, and the large spread persists.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid now at 84.95, still just below the lowest asks starting at 84.96. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I placed a bid of 84.96, slightly increasing from 84.95. The bid queue remains tightly clustered just below the lowest asks, which still start at 84.96. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I increased my bid from 84.96 to 85.51 to surpass the lowest ask prices clustered around 85.5. The bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids from 84.92 to 85.03 and above, aiming to secure a trade this hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to 87.10, surpassing the lowest asks currently starting at 87.05, aiming to break through the sellers' price resistance and secure trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Tara at $84.0
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Mia at $84.3





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered below 85.5; ask prices now clustered starting at 87.05 and higher; sellers remain firm with no willingness to drop below 85.5; previous small bid increments have not secured multiple trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers' ask prices jumping to mid-to-high 87 range indicate increased price resistance; incremental bid increases below 85.5 no longer effective; must bid above lowest ask to initiate trades but balance profit margins. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid decisively above current lowest ask (87.05) but well below true value (100) to signal readiness to transact; monitor trade response closely; prepare to adjust bids dynamically in subsequent hours to balance margin and trade volume before Hour #15 deadline.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.00. The bid queue has bids ranging from 81.3 to 83.7 and asks start at 96.43, indicating a large spread with no immediate trades.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered with the highest bids around 84.00 and asks still significantly higher, mostly above 85. Our bid was increased to 83.00 to improve competitiveness while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows competing bids clustered between 83.0 and 84.5 with sellers' asks still high starting at 84.99. I placed a bid of 83.75 to improve market position amid the persistent large spread and no trades this hour.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue showed my bid at 83.75. The ask queue remains high starting at 84.99 with no trades occurring. I increased my bid to 84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows highly competitive bids clustered between 84.15 and 84.9, with my bid at the top at 84.9. The ask queue remains largely above 84.99. No trades were reported this hour.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 84.90, the top bid but just below the lowest asks at 84.97 and 84.99. No trades occurred this hour, and the large spread persists.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid now at 84.95, still just below the lowest asks starting at 84.96. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I placed a bid of 84.96, slightly increasing from 84.95. The bid queue remains tightly clustered just below the lowest asks, which still start at 84.96. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I increased my bid from 84.96 to 85.51 to surpass the lowest ask prices clustered around 85.5. The bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids from 84.92 to 85.03 and above, aiming to secure a trade this hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to 87.10, surpassing the lowest asks currently starting at 87.05, aiming to break through the sellers' price resistance and secure trades.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of 87.25, positioning just above the lowest ask of 87.05 to break through sellers' price resistance and secure trades.
Hour 12: At Hour 12, the bid queue remains clustered around 85-85.06 from other buyers, with asks starting at 86.5 and higher, lowest ask at 86.5 from Seller Sami. I placed a bid at 87.25 to stay above the lowest asks and secure trades.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue from other buyers remains below 85.1; lowest asks now at 86.25 from Seller Sami, sellers clustered around 86.97 to 87.12. Trades continue at mid-84 prices when bids exceed 87. Lowest asks showing slight downward movement but still above 86.2. #### Thoughts: Bids below 85.5 ineffective; bids at 87.1+ secure trades but reduce profit margin; sellers show resistance near 86-87 range. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 87.25 to stay above sellers' current lowest asks and secure trades; monitor for any further drop in ask prices to adjust bid downwards; avoid increasing bid further to preserve margin unless no trades by next hour; prepare to increase bid closer to 87.5 or higher only if trade urgency rises as hour 15 approaches.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining my bid at 87.25 has consistently allowed me to stay above the lowest sellers' asks, enabling successful trades around the low to mid-84 dollar range. However, my profit margins have been squeezed due to the need to bid above 87 to secure trades, while competing buyers remain clustered below 85.1. I could improve by being more responsive to any downward shifts in seller asks to slightly reduce my bid and improve profitability while still securing trades.",

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue from other buyers remains below 85.1; lowest asks now at 86.25 from Seller Sami, clustered up to 87.05; trades at mid-84 prices occur when bids exceed 87; ask prices show slight downward movement but still above 86.2. #### Thoughts: Bids below 85.5 ineffective; bids at 87.1+ secure trades but reduce margin; sellers resist dropping below 86-87 range. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 87.25 to stay above lowest asks and secure trades; watch for further drops in ask prices to reduce bid and improve margin; avoid bid increase unless no trades by next hour; prepare to increase bid near 87.5 only if urgency rises approaching hour 15.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a high bid of 87.25 secured multiple trades in recent hours, though at a lower margin than ideal. Attempts to undercut sellers by bidding below 85.5 proved ineffective due to seller resistance and lack of trades. The persistent seller ask prices above 86.25 indicate sellers are reluctant to drop further, limiting margin improvement opportunities. Earlier patience to build a position below 85 was worthwhile but the market dynamics shifted, requiring a premium bid to secure trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, the priority is to secure at least one more trade, even if it means accepting a lower profit margin. Maintaining the bid at 87.25 keeps us competitive and likely to transact given current lowest asks. Increasing the bid slightly just above 87.25 is unnecessary as it risks margin without guaranteed additional benefit. Therefore, I will keep the bid at 87.25.",
  "bid": 87.25,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, the bid queue remains below 85.1 from competitors while lowest asks cluster between 85.11 and 92.75. I maintained my bid at 87.25 to remain above all lowest asks and secure trades in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Competitors' bids remain below 85.1; lowest asks cluster at 85.11 to 92.75; sellers maintain firm ask prices above 86.25; past trades mostly around 84-85; my bids at 87.25 consistently secure trades. #### Thoughts: Bids below 85.5 ineffective; sellers reluctant to lower asks under 86; maintaining bid at 87.25 balances trade likelihood and margin in final hour. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 87.25 this hour to secure final trades; avoid bid increase to protect margin; no bid removal as trades likely; finalize position to maximize profitability given market resistance."
