# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- No trades have taken place yet.
- Bid prices cluster around $81.35 to $83.67.
- Ask prices are significantly higher, ranging from $96.25 to $98.45, creating a large spread.

#### Thoughts
- The large spread suggests sellers are currently holding out for higher prices.
- My true value is $100; room exists to increase bids if necessary.
- Early in the market, conservative bidding slightly above current bids can establish presence without sacrificing potential profit.

#### Updated Strategy
- Begin bidding just above the highest bid to stay competitive.
- Monitor bid and ask spread changes each hour.
- Gradually raise bids closer to true value if no trades occur as time progresses.
- Aim to balance profitability with securing trades before Hour #15 closes.

#### Observations: Bid prices continue clustering near $84-$85.25; ask prices remain high over $86.4, with no reduction or trades. Spread remains wide, indicating seller resistance. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yielding on ask prices; buyers are competing just below $85.25. Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but trades unlikely unless spread narrows. True value of $100 allows some upward flexibility, but early overbidding risks margin loss. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $84.50 to test market reaction and maintain queue position. Monitor for any ask price drops. Prepare to gradually raise bids as deadline approaches to secure trades, balancing profitability and trade certainty.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from $81.35 to $83.67 and asks from $96.25 to $98.45. I placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows the bid queue with bids clustered from $82.5 to $85.0 and asks still high above $86.5, with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $84.25, slightly increasing my previous bid to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 opened with bids from $83.69 to $85.25 and asks still high between $86.45 and $96.72. I placed a bid at $84.50, modestly raising my previous $84.25 bid to remain competitive.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with bids clustered between $84.5 and $85.5; asks remain high from $86.41 to $96.72 with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $84.75 to maintain competitiveness just below the top bids.

#### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain queue position but do not trigger trades due to large bid-ask spread. Waiting too long risks missed trading opportunities; acting too soon risks margin erosion.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from $81.35 to $83.67 and asks from $96.25 to $98.45. I placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows the bid queue with bids clustered from $82.5 to $85.0 and asks still high above $86.5, with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $84.25, slightly increasing my previous bid to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 opened with bids from $83.69 to $85.25 and asks still high between $86.45 and $96.72. I placed a bid at $84.50, modestly raising my previous $84.25 bid to remain competitive.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with bids clustered between $84.5 and $85.5; asks remain high from $86.41 to $96.72 with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $84.75 to maintain competitiveness just below the top bids.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opened with bids clustered tightly between $84.75 and $85.75; asks remain stubbornly above $86.39, with no trades recorded. I placed a bid at $85.00, slightly increasing from my previous $84.75 to stay competitive.
Hour 6: Hour #6 opened with bids clustered tightly from $85.0 to $85.9 and asks stubbornly above $86.39, resulting in no trades. I placed a bid at $85.00 to maintain competitiveness.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from $81.35 to $83.67 and asks from $96.25 to $98.45. I placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows the bid queue with bids clustered from $82.5 to $85.0 and asks still high above $86.5, with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $84.25, slightly increasing my previous bid to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 opened with bids from $83.69 to $85.25 and asks still high between $86.45 and $96.72. I placed a bid at $84.50, modestly raising my previous $84.25 bid to remain competitive.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with bids clustered between $84.5 and $85.5; asks remain high from $86.41 to $96.72 with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $84.75 to maintain competitiveness just below the top bids.
Hour 5: Hour #5 opened with bids clustered tightly between $84.75 and $85.75; asks remain stubbornly above $86.39, with no trades recorded. I placed a bid at $85.00, slightly increasing from my previous $84.75 to stay competitive.
Hour 6: Hour #6 opened with bids clustered tightly from $85.0 to $85.9 and asks stubbornly above $86.39, resulting in no trades. I placed a bid at $85.00 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 7: Hour #7 opened with bids clustered from $85.0 to $85.9 and asks stubbornly high above $86.39. I placed a bid at $85.00, maintaining my position at the lower end of the competitive bid range.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $85.50, moving closer to the ask prices clustered above $86.39; bids remain tightly grouped just below asks with no trades yet recorded.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered $85.0-$85.9; asks stable above $86.39; no trades executed this hour.

Increasing bid to $85.50 improves competitiveness and trade likelihood, while still preserving margin relative to true value $100. Sellers not lowering asks yet, so must approach cautiously. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $85.50 this hour to enhance chance of trade.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Luca at $84.9
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Hana at $85.42





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered just below the lowest ask at $86.39; no trades triggered by bids near $86.30; sellers remain firm with no ask price reductions; market shows resistance to crossing current ask threshold. #### Thoughts: Previous incremental bid increases have not induced trades, indicating sellers' strong position; need to narrow bid-ask spread further but profit margin must be preserved; time horizon shortening requires more assertive bidding to secure deals. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.35, slightly closer to lowest ask, to pressure sellers; maintain profitability buffer; prepare to increment bids closer to or at $86.39 if no trades next hour; monitor sellers for any signs of lowering asks to capitalize quickly.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered just below the $86.39 ask with no trades triggered at or above $86.30; sellers hold firm on ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers show reluctance to lower asks below $86.39; previous gradual bid increases have secured trades but only below this threshold; time is limited with only 3 hours left to trade. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $86.38 to pressure sellers and test willingness to transact just below ask; if no trade occurs this hour, be prepared to bid at or slightly above $86.39 next hour to secure trades before market close.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered just below or at the $86.39 ask with sellers unwilling to lower asks; few trades triggered at or just below $86.38; sellers hold firm on ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers are reluctant to reduce ask prices below $86.39, limiting trade opportunities; marginal bid increases have helped secure trades but may have reached a plateau; time is limited with only 2 hours remaining. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above $86.39 to $86.40 to pressure sellers and test willingness to transact above previous bid limits; if no trades occur, consider further small increments next hour to secure trades before market close while balancing profitability.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, gradually increasing bids closer to the lowest ask of $86.39 helped secure trades but did not induce sellers to lower asks. Holding bids just below or at $86.39 has reached a plateau where sellers remain firm. Buying at $86.39 or slightly above has allowed consistent trades, securing inventory but reducing profit margin.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour and sellers hold firm at $86.39+, I will increase my bid slightly above the lowest ask to $86.41 to try to secure one more trade before the market closes, accepting a modest margin reduction for guaranteed acquisition. This small increment tests seller willingness to transact above the ask floor while balancing profitability in the limited remaining time.",
  "bid": 86.41,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 opened with bids clustered tightly just below $86.39 and asks starting at $90.99, higher than previous lowest asks. I placed a bid at $86.41, slightly above the last ask floor to attempt securing a final trade.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers are firm at $86.39 and above; no reduction in lowest asks; bids cluster tightly around $86.39; final hour limits time to negotiate; previous small increments secured trades but sellers did not reduce asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers unlikely to lower asks further; must accept near-ask prices to secure trades; time pressure requires prioritizing trade completion over margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above lowest ask to $86.41 to pressure sellers and secure trade in final hour while maintaining a small margin; if no trade, consider withdrawing bid next hour (if possible) or accept no trade to avoid overpaying."
