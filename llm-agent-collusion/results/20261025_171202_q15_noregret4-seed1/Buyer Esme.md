# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the low 80s and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the highest competing bid of 83.67, aiming to position Vector Technologies as the top buyer without exceeding a cautious margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest competing bid moved up to 85.0. I raised our bid to 85.25, becoming the top buyer and aiming to stimulate trades while protecting profit margins.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 85.25 with our bid tied at the top, but ask prices stay high around 96.24 and a few lower asks near 86.49. No trades were executed. Our bid remains at 85.25.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, bid queue shows top bids at 85.5 and multiple at 85.3, with our previous bid at 85.25. Ask queue still has sellers clustered at about 86.4 to 86.5 and much higher. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.75 to improve competitiveness.

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the low 80s and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the highest competing bid of 83.67, aiming to position Vector Technologies as the top buyer without exceeding a cautious margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest competing bid moved up to 85.0. I raised our bid to 85.25, becoming the top buyer and aiming to stimulate trades while protecting profit margins.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 85.25 with our bid tied at the top, but ask prices stay high around 96.24 and a few lower asks near 86.49. No trades were executed. Our bid remains at 85.25.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, bid queue shows top bids at 85.5 and multiple at 85.3, with our previous bid at 85.25. Ask queue still has sellers clustered at about 86.4 to 86.5 and much higher. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.75 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue shows multiple bids clustered at 85.75 with me among them, and ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.39. Our bid is increased to 85.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to 86.00, slightly above the previous highest competing bid of 85.9, aiming to improve competitiveness and prompt trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Hana at $85.25





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices are tightly clustered in the mid-85 range; asks remain stubbornly above 86.39, preventing trades. Incremental bid increases have not yet closed the spread.
#### Thoughts: Sellers are resistant to lowering asks; raising bids slightly beyond 85.9 may pressure sellers to reduce ask prices or accept trades.
#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.00 to signal stronger buying intent while preserving margin. Monitor seller response closely and adjust bids incrementally if trades still do not occur, balancing margin with trade likelihood.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the low 80s and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the highest competing bid of 83.67, aiming to position Vector Technologies as the top buyer without exceeding a cautious margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest competing bid moved up to 85.0. I raised our bid to 85.25, becoming the top buyer and aiming to stimulate trades while protecting profit margins.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 85.25 with our bid tied at the top, but ask prices stay high around 96.24 and a few lower asks near 86.49. No trades were executed. Our bid remains at 85.25.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, bid queue shows top bids at 85.5 and multiple at 85.3, with our previous bid at 85.25. Ask queue still has sellers clustered at about 86.4 to 86.5 and much higher. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.75 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue shows multiple bids clustered at 85.75 with me among them, and ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.39. Our bid is increased to 85.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to 86.00, slightly above the previous highest competing bid of 85.9, aiming to improve competitiveness and prompt trades.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, I increased our bid to 86.01, slightly above the highest competing bids around 85.9 to 85.95, aiming to push the market closer to a trade. The ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.39 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at 86.02, positioning Vector Technologies as the top buyer just above the highest competing bid of 85.95. The ask queue remains with sellers clustered above 86.39, and no trades have been executed yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Hana at $85.25
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Luca at $85.0
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Noor at $84.01





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster tightly in mid-85 range; asks remain above 86.39, limiting trades. Two successful trades below 86 suggest seller willingness at lower prices. Incremental bid increases have not yet moved ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain resistant to lowering asks; current bid increments maintain margin but do not close gap fully. Slightly raising bid above top competitors may signal stronger demand and pressure sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.02 to become top buyer and push for trades while balancing profit. Monitor seller response; prepare to escalate bids further if no trades occur, optimizing between margin preservation and trade execution.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster tightly around mid-85 to 86.0; ask prices remain above 86.39, limiting trades. Past trades below 86 indicate some seller willingness at lower prices, but current ask prices resist downward movement. Incremental bid increases have not yet closed the gap sufficiently for trades at current ask levels. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm above 86.39; slightly raising bids above top competitors may signal stronger demand and push sellers to reconsider asks. Balancing bid increments to preserve margin while encouraging trades is critical with limited hours left. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above top bids to 86.05 to pressure sellers and prompt trades. Monitor seller response closely; escalate bids further only if necessary to secure trades before Hour 15, while optimizing profit margin and ensuring we do not overbid too early.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the low 80s and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the highest competing bid of 83.67, aiming to position Vector Technologies as the top buyer without exceeding a cautious margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the highest competing bid moved up to 85.0. I raised our bid to 85.25, becoming the top buyer and aiming to stimulate trades while protecting profit margins.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 85.25 with our bid tied at the top, but ask prices stay high around 96.24 and a few lower asks near 86.49. No trades were executed. Our bid remains at 85.25.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, bid queue shows top bids at 85.5 and multiple at 85.3, with our previous bid at 85.25. Ask queue still has sellers clustered at about 86.4 to 86.5 and much higher. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.75 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue shows multiple bids clustered at 85.75 with me among them, and ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.39. Our bid is increased to 85.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to 86.00, slightly above the previous highest competing bid of 85.9, aiming to improve competitiveness and prompt trades.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, I increased our bid to 86.01, slightly above the highest competing bids around 85.9 to 85.95, aiming to push the market closer to a trade. The ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.39 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at 86.02, positioning Vector Technologies as the top buyer just above the highest competing bid of 85.95. The ask queue remains with sellers clustered above 86.39, and no trades have been executed yet.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, I placed a bid at 86.05, slightly above the highest competing bid of 86.0, aiming to push for trades amid asks still clustered above 86.39 with no immediate trade execution.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, I placed a bid at 86.15, slightly above the highest competing bid of 86.11. The ask prices remain clustered stubbornly above 86.39 with no trades executed yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Hana at $85.25
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Luca at $85.0
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Noor at $84.01





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids are tightly clustered from 85.36 to 86.11 with our bid now at 86.15, still below ask prices clustered tightly around 86.39 to 86.49 and much higher. Past trades occurred below 86.0 but recent asks remain firm. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not yet induced sellers to lower asks or accept trades at or near our bids, indicating seller firmness or wait for higher bids. Slightly more aggressive bidding is needed to signal urgency without sacrificing margin prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above highest competing bid to 86.15 to apply pressure on sellers. Closely monitor if sellers adjust asks or trades execute. Escalate bid further only if no progress by next hour, balancing margin preservation with the necessity to secure trades before Hour 15.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Hana at $85.25
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Luca at $85.0
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Noor at $84.01





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered between 85.36 and 86.2, with our bid previously at 86.15. Asks stubbornly hold at 86.39 to 86.49, preventing trades. Past trades have occurred below 86.0, showing sellers' reluctance to accept lower bids. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not induced seller movement; sellers maintain a firm ask level. Our strategy needs to signal stronger willingness to trade without eroding margins prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.25, slightly above highest opposing bid, to push for trades and test seller resolve. Monitor next hour for seller response or trade execution. Prepare to escalate bid further or withdraw if no progress by hour 12 to balance profit preservation and trade necessity.

{

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 4: In Hour 4, bid queue shows top bids at 85.5 and multiple at 85.3, with our previous bid at 85.25. Ask queue still has sellers clustered at about 86.4 to 86.5 and much higher. No trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.75 to improve competitiveness.

Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to 86.00, slightly above the previous highest competing bid of 85.9, aiming to improve competitiveness and prompt trades.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, I increased our bid to 86.01, slightly above the highest competing bids around 85.9 to 85.95, aiming to push the market closer to a trade. The ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.39 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at 86.02, positioning Vector Technologies as the top buyer just above the highest competing bid of 85.95. The ask queue remains with sellers clustered above 86.39, and no trades have been executed yet.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, I placed a bid at 86.05, slightly above the highest competing bid of 86.0, aiming to push for trades amid asks still clustered above 86.39 with no immediate trade execution.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, I placed a bid at 86.15, slightly above the highest competing bid of 86.11. The ask prices remain clustered stubbornly above 86.39 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid at 86.25, slightly above the highest competing bid of 86.2, aiming to push the market closer to trade amid asks still clustered around 86.39 to 86.49.
Hour 12: Placed bid at 86.25, matching highest competing bids and maintaining top buyer position. Sellers remain firm with asks clustered between 86.39 and 86.49, and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Hana at $85.25
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Luca at $85.0

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered at 86.2-86.35, sellers hold firm with asks at 86.39-86.49, no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain top buyer status but do not prompt seller concessions. Sellers' ask prices remain above buyer bids indicating strong seller confidence. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.25 to keep competitive edge and test seller resolve. Monitor market response closely. Prepare to increase bid slightly if no trades next hour or withdraw to preserve margins and reassess in final hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Maintaining 86.25 preserved margin but stalled trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will raise the bid slightly above the current highest bid of 86.39 to 86.40 to become the top buyer and attempt to secure at least one final trade without sacrificing too much profit. This small increase balances the need to trade before close and preserve margin against the true value of 100.",
  "bid": 86.4,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, I placed a bid at 86.40, slightly above the highest bid of 86.39, aiming to secure a final trade before market close. Seller ask prices remain well above 86.39, so the trade outcome is pending.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered 86.25-86.39; sellers firmly hold asks above 86.39; no trades at bids below 86.4 in recent hours. #### Thoughts: Sellers confident at current ask levels; small incremental bid increases preserved margin but failed to induce trades; final hour requires balancing trade execution with profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 86.40 to become top buyer and encourage trade before market closes, accepting a slight margin reduction to avoid missing last trade opportunity."
