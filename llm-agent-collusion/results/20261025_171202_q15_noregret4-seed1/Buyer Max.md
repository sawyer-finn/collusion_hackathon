# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Aggressive bidding risks margin, but too low bids delay trades. Gradual increase in bids can test seller willingness. #### Updated Strategy: Lead bids slightly above the current top bid to increase chances of matching asks.

Maintaining margin below $86.5 is critical to profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $85.30 to lead buyers but stay below lowest ask; monitor ask movement and competitor bids closely; be prepared to raise bids incrementally if no trades occur, but avoid aggressive jumps near true value early on.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $85.00, which is above all other buyers currently bidding between $81.35 and $83.67. No trades have occurred yet, and the lowest ask remains at $96.25.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $86.75 to lead the bid queue and approach the lowest ask of $86.5 from Seller Luca, aiming to initiate trades soon.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue topped at $85.25 from multiple buyers while the lowest asks remain clustered around $86.45 to $86.49. I placed a bid at $85.30, slightly above the highest competing bid to lead the queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue topped at $85.5 but my bid at $85.3 remained competitive; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.4 to $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.40 to lead the buyers.

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $85.00, which is above all other buyers currently bidding between $81.35 and $83.67. No trades have occurred yet, and the lowest ask remains at $96.25.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $86.75 to lead the bid queue and approach the lowest ask of $86.5 from Seller Luca, aiming to initiate trades soon.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue topped at $85.25 from multiple buyers while the lowest asks remain clustered around $86.45 to $86.49. I placed a bid at $85.30, slightly above the highest competing bid to lead the queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue topped at $85.5 but my bid at $85.3 remained competitive; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.4 to $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.40 to lead the buyers.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue topped at $85.75 with my bid at $85.40 leading buyers last hour; lowest asks remained clustered near $86.39-$86.49. I placed a new bid at $85.80 to maintain leadership and test seller willingness to trade.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue topped at $85.9 by Buyer Esme; I maintained my bid at $85.80 to lead buyers. No trades occurred; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.39-$86.49. No significant change in ask prices or buyer competition this hour.

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Noor at $83.62





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at $85.9; my bid at $85.80 leads buyers but no trades; lowest asks stable near $86.39-$86.49; sellers remain firm. #### Thoughts: Sellers unwilling to drop asks closer to buyer bids; buyer bids cluster just below $85.90; need careful balance between pressure and margin retention. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.80 this hour to lead buyers and gradually pressure sellers without sacrificing profit; closely monitor ask price movements or buyer bid increases; prepare incremental bid raises if no trades occur in next hours to secure deals before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $85.00, which is above all other buyers currently bidding between $81.35 and $83.67. No trades have occurred yet, and the lowest ask remains at $96.25.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $86.75 to lead the bid queue and approach the lowest ask of $86.5 from Seller Luca, aiming to initiate trades soon.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue topped at $85.25 from multiple buyers while the lowest asks remain clustered around $86.45 to $86.49. I placed a bid at $85.30, slightly above the highest competing bid to lead the queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue topped at $85.5 but my bid at $85.3 remained competitive; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.4 to $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.40 to lead the buyers.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue topped at $85.75 with my bid at $85.40 leading buyers last hour; lowest asks remained clustered near $86.39-$86.49. I placed a new bid at $85.80 to maintain leadership and test seller willingness to trade.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue topped at $85.9 by Buyer Esme; I maintained my bid at $85.80 to lead buyers. No trades occurred; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.39-$86.49. No significant change in ask prices or buyer competition this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $85.95 to lead buyers and approach the lowest ask prices near $86.39-$86.49, aiming to prompt trades or seller ask price movement this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $85.95 again, keeping the lead in the bid queue. The lowest asks remained clustered near $86.39-$86.49, and no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Noor at $83.62





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at $85.95 by multiple buyers including me; lowest asks steady around $86.39-$86.49; no trades this hour; sellers remain firm; buyers cluster below $86.00.
#### Thoughts: Sellers unlikely to reduce ask prices; buyer bids need to inch closer to ask to induce trades; maintaining bid at $85.95 balances pressure and margin.
#### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.95 to lead buyers and pressure sellers; if no trades within next hour, consider a small incremental bid increase towards $86.00 but avoid exceeding to maintain profitability; monitor for any seller ask price drops or trade occurrences; plan adaptive bidding based on evolving market signals to secure profitable trades before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $86.75 to lead the bid queue and approach the lowest ask of $86.5 from Seller Luca, aiming to initiate trades soon.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue topped at $85.25 from multiple buyers while the lowest asks remain clustered around $86.45 to $86.49. I placed a bid at $85.30, slightly above the highest competing bid to lead the queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue topped at $85.5 but my bid at $85.3 remained competitive; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.4 to $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.40 to lead the buyers.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue topped at $85.75 with my bid at $85.40 leading buyers last hour; lowest asks remained clustered near $86.39-$86.49. I placed a new bid at $85.80 to maintain leadership and test seller willingness to trade.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue topped at $85.9 by Buyer Esme; I maintained my bid at $85.80 to lead buyers. No trades occurred; lowest asks stayed clustered near $86.39-$86.49. No significant change in ask prices or buyer competition this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $85.95 to lead buyers and approach the lowest ask prices near $86.39-$86.49, aiming to prompt trades or seller ask price movement this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $85.95 again, keeping the lead in the bid queue. The lowest asks remained clustered near $86.39-$86.49, and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue topped at $86.0 with my bid leading alongside Buyer Ravi and Buyer Raj, while lowest asks remained steady around $86.39-$86.49. No trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Noor at $83.62





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at $86.0 led by me and others; lowest asks stable at $86.39-$86.49; no trades again despite bid increases. Sellers remain firm and unyielding; buyers cautiously raising bids but spread remains just out of reach. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm; incremental bid increases needed to close spread and stimulate trades; maintaining bid leadership is critical to apply pressure on sellers; risk of eroding margins if bids rise too fast but must ensure trades before hour 15. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.00 this hour to hold leadership and test seller resolve; if no trades, incrementally increase bid to $86.10 in subsequent hours; monitor seller ask movements and competitor bids closely; balance profit focus with trade execution urgency as deadline approaches.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Noor at $83.62





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at $86.0 led by me and others; lowest asks stable at $86.39-$86.49; no trades again despite bid increases. Sellers remain firm and unyielding; buyers cautiously raising bids but spread remains just out of reach. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm; incremental bid increases needed to close spread and stimulate trades; maintaining bid leadership is critical to apply pressure on sellers; risk of eroding margins if bids rise too fast but must ensure trades before hour 15. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.00 this hour to hold leadership and test seller resolve; if no trades, incrementally increase bid to $86.10 in subsequent hours; monitor seller ask movements and competitor bids closely; balance profit focus with trade execution urgency as deadline approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Noor at $83.62





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with ask prices stable around $86.39-$86.49 despite repeated bid increases; bid queue topped near $86.35 by others; no trades yet from my side after multiple attempts. #### Thoughts: Sellers are holding their price, likely waiting for buyers to approach closer to $86.40; incremental bid increases needed but must balance profitability and trade likelihood; leadership in bids is crucial to maintaining pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.30 to lead buyers and narrow gap to seller asks; monitor response closely; if no trades by Hour 14, consider more aggressive bid increases closer to true value $100 to ensure trades before Hour 15; avoid large jumps early to preserve margins.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Noor at $83.62
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Yara at $86.38





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm near $86.39-$86.45; no trades despite leadership in bids; bid queue topped at $86.35 last hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are waiting for bids to approach or exceed $86.40 to transact; incremental bid increases are necessary to maintain pressure and leadership; balance needed between margin preservation and securing trades before last hour. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $86.40 to match/beat lowest ask and test seller willingness to trade; maintain bid leadership; if no trade next hour, prepare to increase bid closer to true value $100 in final hour to ensure trade execution while still seeking profit.

The sellers have consistently held firm above $86.35, showing reluctance to lower prices. Incremental bid increases helped maintain leadership but did not compel sellers to reduce asks. Waiting too long to bid closer to true value risks losing profitable trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, the focus shifts to securing trades by bidding closer to the true value of $100 while still aiming for profit. I will increase my bid to $86.50 to lead and exceed the lowest asks, signaling readiness to transact and potentially triggering sellers to accept. This balances maximizing profitability with ensuring a final trade.",
  "bid": 86.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $86.50, leading the bid queue by exceeding the lowest ask prices, aiming to secure final trades before market close.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm near $86.35-$86.45 and have not dropped despite consistent bidding leadership; trades only triggered when bids matched or slightly exceeded asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers resist lowering asks, so bidding closer to true value is necessary to secure trades; previous cautious increments maintained leadership but delayed trades. #### Updated Strategy: For final hour, increase bid to $86.50 to exceed lowest asks and signal strong buying intent; prioritize securing trades over margin perfection, while still maintaining profitable spread from true value of $100."
