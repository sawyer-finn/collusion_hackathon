# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Since my true value is $100 and the current top bids are around $83.4, I will increase my bid moderately above the highest existing bid to $83.50. This should position me as the top buyer without approaching the ask prices too closely, maintaining potential profit margin while signaling seriousness to sellers.",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with bids ranging from 81.41 to 83.38, and asks from 96.31 to 97.8. I placed a bid at $83.50, making me the highest bidder so far.
Hour 2: Hour 2 saw a bid queue with my new highest bid at $84.00, slightly above the prior $83.50. The ask queue remains largely unchanged with the lowest asks still above $86. No trades occurred at my bid level.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue still shows a tightly clustered set of bids below $84.00 except mine at $84.00 and Ivo, Jin, and others slightly below. Ask prices remain mostly above $85.50. I placed a bid at $84.50, the highest so far.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, I placed a bid at $84.50, continuing to lead the bid queue just below the lowest asks, which remain at $84.5 and above, with no trades executed at my bid level yet.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with bids ranging from 81.41 to 83.38, and asks from 96.31 to 97.8. I placed a bid at $83.50, making me the highest bidder so far.
Hour 2: Hour 2 saw a bid queue with my new highest bid at $84.00, slightly above the prior $83.50. The ask queue remains largely unchanged with the lowest asks still above $86. No trades occurred at my bid level.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue still shows a tightly clustered set of bids below $84.00 except mine at $84.00 and Ivo, Jin, and others slightly below. Ask prices remain mostly above $85.50. I placed a bid at $84.50, the highest so far.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, I placed a bid at $84.50, continuing to lead the bid queue just below the lowest asks, which remain at $84.5 and above, with no trades executed at my bid level yet.
Hour 5: Hour 5 opens with bids clustered below $84.20 and lowest asks steady at $84.49; I placed a bid at $84.20, positioning just below the lowest asks to probe seller resistance.
Hour 6: Hour 6 opened with the lowest asks steady at $84.39-$84.48 and the bid queue clustered at $84.20, including my bid. No trades executed at my bid level this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Leo at $84.0
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Bram at $83.75





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Lowest asks remain firm around $84.39-$84.48; bid prices cluster at $84.20 including my bid; no trades at or above $84.20; successful trades occur slightly below ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain ask price resistance; buyers cluster bids just below asks, suggesting market equilibrium near $84.20-$84.48; incremental bid increases risk margin erosion without guaranteed trades. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $84.20 to maintain top bid position, test seller willingness to lower asks, and preserve margins; monitor for shifts in ask prices or trade execution; prepare to increase bid slightly if no favorable movement by next hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Leo at $84.0

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Low asks firmly at $84.33-$84.38; bids clustered around $84.2 including mine; no trades executed at or above $84.2; sellers show resistance to price drops. #### Thoughts: Market appears to be at a temporary equilibrium with sellers unwilling to reduce asks; buyers hesitant to raise bids above $84.2 due to margin concerns. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.2 to remain highest bidder and monitor seller reaction; preserve margin while applying steady pressure; be ready to adjust bid moderately upward if no trades by Hour 9 to improve trade chances without sacrificing profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "reflection": "My previous bid of $84.33 matched the highest bids in the queue but did not result in a trade.

This suggests sellers are holding out for better prices, and my current bid level has yet to prompt any seller concessions or trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "I will maintain a competitive bid slightly above the cluster of $84.31 bids to keep a strong position in the queue, but I will not increase the bid significantly since the ask prices remain far above. The goal is to balance staying the highest bidder to signal seriousness without overpaying, while monitoring any reduction in ask prices or trade activity to adjust strategy accordingly.",
  "bid": 84.34,
  "new_memory": "Hour 10 opened with bid queue clustered at $84.2 to $84.31 and asks still high above $95. I placed a bid at $84.34, slightly above the highest bids.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers' asks are significantly higher than buyer bids, with no movement from sellers despite bids clustering just below $84.34. Trades continue to execute at prices near $84.3 but not at the ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers seem to hold firm high asks, possibly expecting buyers to increase bids more aggressively. The narrow bid cluster suggests a cautious buyer market, but I must avoid overbidding. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain incremental bid increases just above top bids to remain highest bidder and push for trades at profitable prices.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with bids ranging from 81.41 to 83.38, and asks from 96.31 to 97.8. I placed a bid at $83.50, making me the highest bidder so far.
Hour 2: Hour 2 saw a bid queue with my new highest bid at $84.00, slightly above the prior $83.50. The ask queue remains largely unchanged with the lowest asks still above $86. No trades occurred at my bid level.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue still shows a tightly clustered set of bids below $84.00 except mine at $84.00 and Ivo, Jin, and others slightly below. Ask prices remain mostly above $85.50. I placed a bid at $84.50, the highest so far.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, I placed a bid at $84.50, continuing to lead the bid queue just below the lowest asks, which remain at $84.5 and above, with no trades executed at my bid level yet.
Hour 5: Hour 5 opens with bids clustered below $84.20 and lowest asks steady at $84.49; I placed a bid at $84.20, positioning just below the lowest asks to probe seller resistance.
Hour 6: Hour 6 opened with the lowest asks steady at $84.39-$84.48 and the bid queue clustered at $84.20, including my bid. No trades executed at my bid level this hour.
Hour 7: Hour 7 opened with bids clustered around $84.2 and lowest asks steady at $84.34-$84.38. I maintained my bid at $84.2, remaining the top bid with no immediate trade executions.
Hour 8: Hour 8 opened with bids clustered around $84.2 including my bid, and lowest asks steady at $84.33. No trades occurred at my bid level. I placed a bid at $84.2, maintaining top bid position.
Hour 9: Hour 9 opened with bids clustered just below lowest asks at $84.32; I placed a bid at $84.33, slightly surpassing the top bids to press sellers for a trade.
Hour 10: Hour 10 opened with bid queue clustered at $84.2 to $84.31 and asks still high above $95. I placed a bid at $84.34, slightly above the highest bids.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Leo at $84.0
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Bram at $83.75
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Tara at $84.32
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Maya at $84.33





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks are significantly higher than buyer bids, with no movement from sellers despite bids clustering just below $84.34. Trades continue to execute at prices near $84.3 but not at the ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers seem to hold firm high asks, possibly expecting buyers to increase bids more aggressively. The narrow bid cluster suggests a cautious buyer market, but I must avoid overbidding. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain incremental bid increases just above top bids to remain highest bidder and push for trades at profitable prices. Avoid large jumps in bid price until sellers show signs of lowering asks. Monitor market for any ask price drops or trade executions to adjust bid levels accordingly.


# Output Format

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

{
  "reflection": "Previous incremental bid increases slightly above top bids have secured trades at around $84.3, maintaining profitability below my true value of $100. This cautious approach avoids overpaying but hasn't incentivized sellers to lower their high asks. The lack of ask price movement suggests sellers expect higher bids or market demand to rise. A more assertive but controlled bid increase might provoke sellers to lower asks or yield trades before the time horizon tightens.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "I will increase my bid moderately above the current top bids at $84.33 to $84.36, continuing to lead the bid queue while preserving margin. This small step up signals stronger buying interest without conceding too much potential profit. I will monitor if this nudges sellers to adjust asks downward or triggers trades. If no progress occurs, I will consider a slightly larger increment next hour to accelerate trades before the final hours.",
  "bid": 84.36,
  "new_memory": "Hour 11 opened with bids clustered at $84.31 to $84.33 and asks high at $95+; I placed a bid at $84.36, slightly above the highest bids to maintain top bid position and probe seller reaction.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain firmly above $95 despite bids clustering near $84.33, and trades execute near $84.3 but not at ask levels. Incremental bid increases have secured occasional trades around $84.3 but haven't pressured sellers to lower asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers likely expect stronger buyer bids or higher market demand. Current small bid increments maintain profitability but risk missing trades if sellers don't adjust. #### Updated Strategy: Continue nudging bids slightly above top buyer bids to signal increased willingness to buy without sacrificing margin. If sellers hold firm, prepare to increase bid increments more aggressively in coming hours to secure trades before final hour, balancing profit and volume."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firmly above $95 despite bids clustering near $84.33, and trades execute near $84.3 but not at ask levels. Incremental bid increases have secured occasional trades around $84.3 but haven't pressured sellers to lower asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers likely expect stronger buyer bids or higher market demand. Current small bid increments maintain profitability but risk missing trades if sellers don't adjust. #### Updated Strategy: Continue nudging bids slightly above top buyer bids to signal increased willingness to buy without sacrificing margin. If sellers hold firm, prepare to increase bid increments more aggressively in coming hours to secure trades before final hour, balancing profit and volume.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain high above $93.5, with trades continuing near $84.3. Bid increments of a few cents have allowed occasional trades but not lowered seller asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers with asks above $93.5 appear inactive; market activity is concentrated near $84.3. Incremental bid increases keep me competitive but risk missing trades if sellers stay firm. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above top bids to signal stronger buying interest without sacrificing margin. Monitor seller ask movement closely; prepare for more aggressive bid increases in subsequent hours if asks remain high to secure trades before hour 15.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain high above $90 with most near $94 to $96, far above trade prices around $84.3. Bid increments slightly above $84.3 have secured trades but not reduced seller ask prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers at high ask levels appear inactive or unwilling to lower prices. Incremental bid increases maintain top bid and secure trades near $84.3 but the ask-bid spread remains large. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid slightly higher at $84.38 to signal stronger buying intent and maintain top bid position. Monitor for any downward movement in seller asks. Prepare to increase bid more aggressively if sellers remain firm heading into final hours to secure trades before hour 15, balancing margin and volume.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain high above $90 with most near $94 to $96, far above trade prices around $84.3. Bid increments slightly above $84.3 have secured trades but not reduced seller ask prices. No sign of sellers lowering asks despite sustained top bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers are anchored at high ask levels and inactive in lowering prices. Maintaining a top bid near $84.3 secures trades but does not close the large ask-bid spread. Incremental bid increases signal intent but have limited effect on ask prices. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid slightly higher at $84.39 to maintain top bid status and test seller resolve. Monitor for any downward movement in seller asks. Prepare to increase bid more aggressively near $84.50 in Hour 15 to secure final trades balancing margin and volume.

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining the top bid near $84.3-$84.4 range, seller ask prices have remained stubbornly high above $90, showing strong resistance and no willingness to lower their asks closer to the bid levels. Incremental bid increases have secured trades at around $83.19 to $84.33 but have not narrowed the ask-bid spread. This suggests sellers are either anchored at high ask prices or holding out for better offers. My approach to stay just above the highest bids has successfully captured trades but limited margin expansion.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the final hour and the persistent wide spread, I will increase my bid more aggressively to $84.50 to maximize the chance of securing additional trades while still maintaining a healthy margin below my true value of $100. This balanced approach aims to finalize profitable purchases by signaling stronger buying intent and potentially pressuring sellers to accept trades closer to $84.50.",
  "bid": 84.5,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 opened with bids clustered below $84.34 and asks still firmly above $90. I placed a bid at $84.50, the highest bid so far, to aggressively pursue final trades before market close.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller ask prices stubbornly remain above $90 despite sustained top bids in the mid-$84 range. Incremental bid increases have secured trades but no narrowing of ask-bid spread. Final hour pressures buyers to balance margin and trade completion. #### Thoughts: Sellers anchored at high asks limit margin improvement. More aggressive bidding needed to secure final trades. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $84.50 to maximize trade likelihood with good margin, signaling stronger buyer intent to pressure sellers before close."
