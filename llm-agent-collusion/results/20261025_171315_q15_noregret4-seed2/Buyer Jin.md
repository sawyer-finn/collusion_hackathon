# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Opening bids cluster between 81.41 and 83.38.
- Opening asks cluster between 96.31 and 97.8, a wide spread from bids.
- No trades have occurred yet.

#### Thoughts
- The wide bid-ask spread suggests sellers expect higher prices, buyers lower.
- Positioning just above the highest bid may attract sellers willing to lower asks.
- Must monitor how asks respond to bids in coming hours.

#### Updated Strategy
- Maintain a bid slightly above the highest current bid to improve chances of trade.
- Avoid bidding close to true value early to preserve margin.
- Adjust bids based on how the ask prices evolve and any trades that occur.
- Be ready to increase bid gradually if market tightens or sellers lower asks.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids between 81.41 and 83.38 and asks between 96.31 and 97.8. I placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the current highest bid to gain a competitive position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 saw the bid queue remain clustered at 83.50 with multiple buyers including myself, while asks remain high mostly around 96 and above, except for some lower asks at 86, 88.5 and 90.5. My bid stayed at 83.50.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with highest bids rising slightly; asks continue mostly above 85 with some at 85.5 and 85.99. I placed a bid at 83.70 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered from 83.5 to 84.1 with several buyers at 84.05 and one at 84.1. Asks remain high mostly above 85, but one seller at 84.5 may be a near-term trading opportunity. My bid is set at 83.90.

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids between 81.41 and 83.38 and asks between 96.31 and 97.8. I placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the current highest bid to gain a competitive position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 saw the bid queue remain clustered at 83.50 with multiple buyers including myself, while asks remain high mostly around 96 and above, except for some lower asks at 86, 88.5 and 90.5. My bid stayed at 83.50.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with highest bids rising slightly; asks continue mostly above 85 with some at 85.5 and 85.99. I placed a bid at 83.70 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered from 83.5 to 84.1 with several buyers at 84.05 and one at 84.1. Asks remain high mostly above 85, but one seller at 84.5 may be a near-term trading opportunity. My bid is set at 83.90.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue shows a tight cluster reaching up to 84.15 and seller asks remain mostly high with the lowest at 84.49. I placed a bid at 84.20 to improve competitiveness near sellers at 84.49.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, bid queue continues to cluster just above 84 with multiple buyers at 84.20 including myself; lowest seller asks remain steady near 84.39-84.48. I placed a bid at 84.35 to improve chances of trade.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered between 83.58 and 84.2 with multiple buyers at 84.2; lowest seller asks remain around 84.39-84.48; no trades for us yet but other buyers are trading slightly below seller asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers holding firm near 84.4-84.5; to engage sellers need to bid closer to their ask prices; incremental increases help keep margin while increasing trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 84.35 this hour to position just below lowest asks and increase likelihood of trade; monitor seller ask movement and be ready to adjust bid upwards cautiously if no trade occurs next hour.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids between 81.41 and 83.38 and asks between 96.31 and 97.8. I placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the current highest bid to gain a competitive position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 saw the bid queue remain clustered at 83.50 with multiple buyers including myself, while asks remain high mostly around 96 and above, except for some lower asks at 86, 88.5 and 90.5. My bid stayed at 83.50.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with highest bids rising slightly; asks continue mostly above 85 with some at 85.5 and 85.99. I placed a bid at 83.70 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered from 83.5 to 84.1 with several buyers at 84.05 and one at 84.1. Asks remain high mostly above 85, but one seller at 84.5 may be a near-term trading opportunity. My bid is set at 83.90.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue shows a tight cluster reaching up to 84.15 and seller asks remain mostly high with the lowest at 84.49. I placed a bid at 84.20 to improve competitiveness near sellers at 84.49.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, bid queue continues to cluster just above 84 with multiple buyers at 84.20 including myself; lowest seller asks remain steady near 84.39-84.48. I placed a bid at 84.35 to improve chances of trade.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remains clustered with highest bids around 84.3; seller asks hold steady near 84.34 to 84.38. I placed a bid at 84.40 to improve competitiveness just below seller asks.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below seller asks at 84.33, and I placed a bid at 84.40 to improve competitiveness and attempt to secure favorable trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Ines at $83.67
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Dev at $82.2
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Bram at $83.2





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered below 84.31; seller asks stable near 84.33-84.38; bids at 84.35-84.40 have yielded successful trades just below 84.0. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain resistance near 84.33-84.38; competitive bids around 84.40 improve trade chances while preserving margin; willingness to slightly increase bids if sellers reduce asks. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.40 to outbid buyers near 84.3 and stay just below seller asks; monitor ask prices for possible downward movement; prepare to increment bid cautiously to meet asks if trading stalls.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids between 81.41 and 83.38 and asks between 96.31 and 97.8. I placed a bid at 83.50, slightly above the current highest bid to gain a competitive position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 saw the bid queue remain clustered at 83.50 with multiple buyers including myself, while asks remain high mostly around 96 and above, except for some lower asks at 86, 88.5 and 90.5. My bid stayed at 83.50.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with highest bids rising slightly; asks continue mostly above 85 with some at 85.5 and 85.99. I placed a bid at 83.70 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue is tightly clustered from 83.5 to 84.1 with several buyers at 84.05 and one at 84.1. Asks remain high mostly above 85, but one seller at 84.5 may be a near-term trading opportunity. My bid is set at 83.90.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue shows a tight cluster reaching up to 84.15 and seller asks remain mostly high with the lowest at 84.49. I placed a bid at 84.20 to improve competitiveness near sellers at 84.49.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, bid queue continues to cluster just above 84 with multiple buyers at 84.20 including myself; lowest seller asks remain steady near 84.39-84.48. I placed a bid at 84.35 to improve chances of trade.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remains clustered with highest bids around 84.3; seller asks hold steady near 84.34 to 84.38. I placed a bid at 84.40 to improve competitiveness just below seller asks.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below seller asks at 84.33, and I placed a bid at 84.40 to improve competitiveness and attempt to secure favorable trades.
Hour 9: Hour 9 bid placed at 84.40 to stay competitive just below seller asks at 84.32, with bid queue clustered up to 84.31 and seller asks steady at 84.32.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, the bid queue remained clustered just below 84.31 with several buyers, while seller asks held high around 95.49 and above. I placed a bid at 84.40 to maintain a competitive position near the top bids.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered just below 84.31; seller asks are currently high around 95.49 and above, far from bid prices; past successful trades occurred when asks dropped below 84.5; no recent sellers near 84.3 or below. #### Thoughts: Sellers are currently holding high asks, likely waiting for higher bids; bids around 84.40 have proven effective for securing trades when asks dropped; maintaining bid just above 84.31 keeps me competitive; no incentive yet to increase bid significantly due to high asks. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.40 to stay highest bid and be ready to transact if sellers reduce asks; monitor for any ask price drops; if ask prices fall closer to 84.3, consider incrementally increasing bid to secure trades; avoid aggressive bid increases while seller asks remain high to preserve profit margin.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered around 84.31-84.33; seller asks are high at 95.49+, creating a wide bid-ask spread and limiting trade opportunities. Past trades occurred when seller asks were near or below 84.4; current sellers hold out for much higher prices. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid just above 84.3 keeps a competitive edge but does not incentivize sellers to lower their asks yet. Aggressive bid increases risk margin erosion without guarantee of trade. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.40 to be ready to transact if asks drop, while preserving margin by not chasing high asks. Monitor ask prices closely for any downward movement. If asks approach mid-80s, incrementally increase bids to secure trades. Avoid withdrawing bid to maintain market presence but remain ready to adjust strategy if market shifts.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remains clustered with highest bids around 84.3; seller asks hold steady near 84.34 to 84.38. I placed a bid at 84.40 to improve competitiveness just below seller asks.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below seller asks at 84.33, and I placed a bid at 84.40 to improve competitiveness and attempt to secure favorable trades.
Hour 9: Hour 9 bid placed at 84.40 to stay competitive just below seller asks at 84.32, with bid queue clustered up to 84.31 and seller asks steady at 84.32.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, the bid queue remained clustered just below 84.31 with several buyers, while seller asks held high around 95.49 and above. I placed a bid at 84.40 to maintain a competitive position near the top bids.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, the bid queue remains clustered just below 84.33, and seller asks hold high near 95.49 and above. I placed a bid at 84.40 to maintain a strong competitive position.
Hour 12: Hour 12 sees stable bid queue clustered around 84.31-84.35 and seller asks stubbornly high from 93.5 to 98. I placed a bid at 84.40 to maintain competitiveness near top bids.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered around 84.31-84.35; seller asks persistently high from 93.5 to 98, creating a wide bid-ask spread that restricts trade opportunities. Past trades occurred only when seller asks were near or below 84.4. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid at 84.40 sustains a competitive edge but does not push sellers to lower asks. Increasing bids aggressively risks margin loss without assurance of trade. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bid at 84.40 to keep market presence and be ready to transact if asks drop nearer to mid-80s. Avoid withdrawing bid to maintain leverage and monitor ask prices for downward movement. Prepare to incrementally raise bids only if sellers show willingness to reduce asking prices.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered tightly at 84.31-84.35; seller asks remain stubbornly high above 90, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread. Past trades occur only near or below 84.4. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 84.40 keeps competitive edge but fails to compel sellers to lower asks. Aggressive bid increases risk margins without assured trades. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.40 to sustain market presence and readiness to trade if sellers lower asks near mid-80s. Avoid bid withdrawal to preserve leverage. Monitor ask prices for downward trends and consider incremental bid increases only if sellers reduce asks significantly.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at 84.31-84.33; seller asks persistently above 93.75, maintaining wide bid-ask spread; past trades take place near or below 84.4. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 84.40 retains top competitive position but fails to prompt sellers to lower asks; aggressive bid increases risk margins without guaranteed trades. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 84.40 to sustain market presence and readiness to trade if sellers lower asks near mid-80s; avoid bid withdrawal to preserve leverage; monitor ask prices closely for downward moves and consider incremental bid increases only if asks drop significantly.

{
  "reflection": "Over the past hours, maintaining a bid of 84.40 has kept me in a strong competitive position, but sellers have not lowered their ask prices below the mid-90s, resulting in no trades at those levels. My successful trades were secured below 84, mostly around 82.2 to 83.67, highlighting the market's resistance to higher bid prices. Incremental bid increases above 84.40 have not been pursued due to risk of reducing profit margins without guarantee of trade.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and asks remain stubbornly high, I will maintain my bid at 84.40 to keep a competitive edge and capitalize on any last-minute seller ask reductions. With no sellers lowering their asks into the mid-80s, aggressive bid increases are unjustified. Preserving margin while staying top bidder maximizes profitability and trade probability in this constrained time.",
  "bid": 84.4,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 bid placed at 84.40; bid queue remains tightly clustered between 84.31 and 84.34; seller asks persist above 93.0, maintaining wide bid-ask spread.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at 84.31-84.34; seller asks remain above 93, far from bids; past trades occur near or below 84.4; no significant ask decreases despite stable bids. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 84.40 secures top position but does not provoke ask drop; aggressive bid increases risk margins without clear trade benefit; ask prices indicate seller resistance to lowering below 90+. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 84.40 for final hour to remain competitive; avoid bid withdrawal to maintain market presence; monitor for any ask drop; prioritize profitability over forced trades in last hour."
