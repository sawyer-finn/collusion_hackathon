# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly increasing from the previous $81.45 to be more competitive within the bid queue without risking immediate overpayment.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.5 to $85.00, moving closer to the ask prices but still below the lowest ask of $86.0, in an attempt to increase the chances of a trade.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I maintained my bid at $85.00, observing that the bid queue remains clustered below $84.0 and asks are still mostly above $85.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $85.45 in Hour #4, slightly increasing from $85.00 to match the lowest recent asks around $85.45 to encourage potential trades.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly increasing from the previous $81.45 to be more competitive within the bid queue without risking immediate overpayment.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.5 to $85.00, moving closer to the ask prices but still below the lowest ask of $86.0, in an attempt to increase the chances of a trade.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I maintained my bid at $85.00, observing that the bid queue remains clustered below $84.0 and asks are still mostly above $85.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $85.45 in Hour #4, slightly increasing from $85.00 to match the lowest recent asks around $85.45 to encourage potential trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I maintained my bid at $85.45, matching the lowest asks to encourage trades, but no trades were observed as sellers held firm above $85.4 and buyers remained clustered below $84.15.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I raised my bid slightly from $85.45 to $85.50 to test market willingness to trade above the current resistance. Bid queue remains clustered below $84.2, and asks are still mostly above $84.39, indicating sellers' firmness.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered below $84.2; sellers hold firm with asks mostly above $84.39, especially a cluster at $84.48; no trades despite bids matching lowest asks previously at $85.45. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain a strong resistance near $84.4-$85.45; buyers reluctant to exceed $84.2 significantly; previous bid matches failed to trigger trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increment bid slightly to $85.50 to probe seller flexibility and signal stronger buying intent; avoid large jumps to preserve profit margin; continue careful monitoring of bid/ask shifts; be prepared to withdraw or adjust bids if market conditions worsen or no liquidity emerges at this level.

Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly increasing from the previous $81.45 to be more competitive within the bid queue without risking immediate overpayment.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.5 to $85.00, moving closer to the ask prices but still below the lowest ask of $86.0, in an attempt to increase the chances of a trade.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I maintained my bid at $85.00, observing that the bid queue remains clustered below $84.0 and asks are still mostly above $85.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $85.45 in Hour #4, slightly increasing from $85.00 to match the lowest recent asks around $85.45 to encourage potential trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I maintained my bid at $85.45, matching the lowest asks to encourage trades, but no trades were observed as sellers held firm above $85.4 and buyers remained clustered below $84.15.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I raised my bid slightly from $85.45 to $85.50 to test market willingness to trade above the current resistance. Bid queue remains clustered below $84.2, and asks are still mostly above $84.39, indicating sellers' firmness.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the bid queue is tightly clustered below $84.3 with several buyers at $84.2, while sellers hold firm around $84.38 to $84.48. I placed a bid at $84.35 to improve competitiveness while maintaining profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly increasing from the previous $81.45 to be more competitive within the bid queue without risking immediate overpayment.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.5 to $85.00, moving closer to the ask prices but still below the lowest ask of $86.0, in an attempt to increase the chances of a trade.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I maintained my bid at $85.00, observing that the bid queue remains clustered below $84.0 and asks are still mostly above $85.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $85.45 in Hour #4, slightly increasing from $85.00 to match the lowest recent asks around $85.45 to encourage potential trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I maintained my bid at $85.45, matching the lowest asks to encourage trades, but no trades were observed as sellers held firm above $85.4 and buyers remained clustered below $84.15.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I raised my bid slightly from $85.45 to $85.50 to test market willingness to trade above the current resistance. Bid queue remains clustered below $84.2, and asks are still mostly above $84.39, indicating sellers' firmness.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the bid queue is tightly clustered below $84.3 with several buyers at $84.2, while sellers hold firm around $84.38 to $84.48. I placed a bid at $84.35 to improve competitiveness while maintaining profitability.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, the bid queue remained clustered below $84.31 with sellers firm at $84.33, and I placed my bid at $84.35 to maintain a competitive yet profitable position.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue remained tightly clustered just below $84.31 and sellers held firm at $84.32. I placed a bid at $84.35 to maintain a competitive edge while preserving margin.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below $84.31, sellers remain firm with asks starting at $95.49 and above, indicating no immediate market softening. I placed my bid at $84.35 to maintain a competitive position.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered below $84.31; sellers firm with asks at $95.49 and above, causing a large spread and fewer trade opportunities. Previous trades clustered under $84.4. #### Thoughts: Market shows significant ask price anomaly or reduced lower ask liquidity, limiting immediate trades; maintaining bid at $84.35 holds competitive edge without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $84.35 to preserve profits while remaining competitive; monitor ask prices closely for potential softening; be prepared to adjust bids if asks lower to increase trade likelihood before final hours.

# Market Rules

Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue remained tightly clustered just below $84.31 and sellers held firm at $84.32. I placed a bid at $84.35 to maintain a competitive edge while preserving margin.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below $84.31, sellers remain firm with asks starting at $95.49 and above, indicating no immediate market softening. I placed my bid at $84.35 to maintain a competitive position.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, the bid queue remains clustered below $84.31 and sellers maintain high asks starting at $95.49. I placed a bid at $84.35 to remain competitive while preserving margin.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered below $84.35; sellers firm at $84.29 with asks much higher starting at $90.5, creating a large spread and limiting trade opportunities. Past trades are consistently below $84.4.
#### Thoughts: The market shows strong seller resistance at high ask prices, limiting upward price movements. Maintaining a bid at $84.35 secures trades and preserves margin. Incremental bid increases should only be considered if asks soften near $84.3.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.35 to secure trades and profit. Monitor ask queue closely for any softening near $84.3 and cautiously increase bid if warranted. Avoid chasing high asks over $90+ to minimize risk.

Maintaining a bid near $84.35 balances competitiveness and profitability well.\n#### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at $84.35 to continue securing trades while preserving margin. Watch ask queue for any downward movement near $84.3 before considering bid increases. Avoid chasing high asks to limit overpayment risk given the short remaining time."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered just under $84.35; sellers keep asks significantly higher above $90, maintaining a large spread and restricting trade volume. Recent trades consistently occur below $84.4.
#### Thoughts: Sellers show no sign of softening near the current bid cluster, so increasing bids risks margin without guaranteed trades. Maintaining a bid near $84.35 balances competitiveness and profitability well.
#### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at $84.35 to continue securing trades while preserving margin. Watch ask queue for any downward movement near $84.3 before considering bid increases. Avoid chasing high asks to limit overpayment risk given the short remaining time.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining the bid at $84.35 over the past hours has allowed consistent trades at prices below $84.4, securing volume without sacrificing too much margin. Attempts to raise bids higher were met with ask prices that stayed well above $90, indicating seller resistance and a wide spread. This conservative approach balanced profitability and trade securing effectively.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "As this is the final hour, I will maintain the bid at $84.35 to continue capturing trades at a profitable level without risking overpayment. The ask queue remains significantly higher, so increasing the bid risks margin erosion without clear benefit. Securing final trades now is critical, and the current bid is competitive enough to clear available asks near $84.3 if any soften.",
  "bid": 84.35,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just below $84.35, with sellers holding firm with asks well above $90. I placed my bid at $84.35 to stay competitive and secure profitable trades.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered just under $84.35; sellers continue with asks significantly above $90, maintaining a large spread and limiting trade opportunities. Recent trades consistently occur below $84.4. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no indication of lowering asks near the bid cluster; raising bids risks margin without guaranteed trades. Maintaining the bid near $84.35 balances competitiveness and profitability optimally given the time constraints. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at $84.35 to secure final trades while preserving margin. Monitor ask queue for any downward movement, but avoid chasing high asks to prevent overpayment on the last hour."
