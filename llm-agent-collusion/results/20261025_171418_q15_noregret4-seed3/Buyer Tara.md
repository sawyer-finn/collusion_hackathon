#### Observations
- Bids range from $81.31 to $83.59, all well below my true value of $100.
- Asks are high, from $96.32 to $98.49, leaving a wide bid-ask spread.

#### Thoughts
- The market has a wide spread; sellers are pricing high and buyers low.
- A bid slightly above the current highest bid may increase chances of trade without sacrificing too much margin.
- I must monitor how bids and asks evolve to adjust my strategy dynamically.

#### Updated Strategy
- Start with a competitive bid just above the highest current bid to position favorably.
- Observe if the spread narrows in subsequent hours to adjust bid upwards accordingly.
- Balance between securing trades and maximizing profit, aiming to trade near my true value as time progresses.

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Lena at $84.9
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Omar at $84.25





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain below $84.3, while asks cluster tightly at $84.95-$85.00. Trade success at $84.9 last hour suggests sellers may accept slightly lower bids. #### Thoughts: Incrementally increasing bid closer to asks can improve trade chances without sacrificing margin. Market prices are stable but spread remains wide. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid modestly to $84.50 to signal competitiveness and encourage sellers to consider lowering asks, while maintaining room for profit.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed bid prices clustering between $81.31 and $83.59, and ask prices from $96.32 to $98.49. I placed a bid at $83.60, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows bids crowded around $82.0 to $84.0, with my bid at $83.6 remaining competitive. Asks still begin at $85.0 with some sellers at this price, indicating a potential entry point. I am now placing a bid at $84.90 to approach the lowest asks.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, bids remain below $84.25 with sellers clustered at $84.95 and $85.00. I placed a bid at $84.50 to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids are clustered between $83.5 and $84.5, with asks tightly clustered at $84.88 to $84.94. I placed a bid at $84.85, just below the lowest asks, to increase competitiveness.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed bid prices clustering between $81.31 and $83.59, and ask prices from $96.32 to $98.49. I placed a bid at $83.60, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows bids crowded around $82.0 to $84.0, with my bid at $83.6 remaining competitive. Asks still begin at $85.0 with some sellers at this price, indicating a potential entry point. I am now placing a bid at $84.90 to approach the lowest asks.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, bids remain below $84.25 with sellers clustered at $84.95 and $85.00. I placed a bid at $84.50 to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids are clustered between $83.5 and $84.5, with asks tightly clustered at $84.88 to $84.94. I placed a bid at $84.85, just below the lowest asks, to increase competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered between $83.91 and $84.85 with my bid at $84.85 shared by Buyer Dev; asks remain tightly clustered at $84.87. I raised my bid to $84.87 to be at the lowest ask price and gain priority.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids cluster just below or at $84.85, with asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.86 matching the lowest ask to increase trade likelihood.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered just below or at $84.85 with asks strictly at $84.86. Sellers continue to hold firm at this ask price with little downward movement. #### Thoughts: Matching the ask price exactly can position me as the most competitive buyer and increase trade execution probability, especially since competitors mostly bid slightly below. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.86, the lowest ask, to secure trades while preserving margins and preparing for a gradual increase if sellers become more aggressive or time pressure increases towards later hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed bid prices clustering between $81.31 and $83.59, and ask prices from $96.32 to $98.49. I placed a bid at $83.60, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows bids crowded around $82.0 to $84.0, with my bid at $83.6 remaining competitive. Asks still begin at $85.0 with some sellers at this price, indicating a potential entry point. I am now placing a bid at $84.90 to approach the lowest asks.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, bids remain below $84.25 with sellers clustered at $84.95 and $85.00. I placed a bid at $84.50 to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids are clustered between $83.5 and $84.5, with asks tightly clustered at $84.88 to $84.94. I placed a bid at $84.85, just below the lowest asks, to increase competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered between $83.91 and $84.85 with my bid at $84.85 shared by Buyer Dev; asks remain tightly clustered at $84.87. I raised my bid to $84.87 to be at the lowest ask price and gain priority.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids cluster just below or at $84.85, with asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.86 matching the lowest ask to increase trade likelihood.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I observe bids clustered at or below $84.85 and asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.87 to outbid competitors and increase trade likelihood.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, bids clustered just below or at $84.85 with asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.87 to outbid competitors and increase chances for trade execution.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster at $84.85, asks at $84.86; sellers remain firm with minimal price movement. Past trades show occasional deals at lower prices ($82-$83) but majority near $84.85. #### Thoughts: Holding $84.87 bid secures queue priority and trade execution near lowest ask, balancing profitability and participation. Slight seller flexibility exists but is limited. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $84.87 bid to outbid clustered $84.85 buyers and match the lowest asks, maximizing chances of trade execution while preserving margins. Monitor market dynamics for potential need to adjust bid price marginally if seller behavior changes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed bid prices clustering between $81.31 and $83.59, and ask prices from $96.32 to $98.49. I placed a bid at $83.60, slightly above the highest existing bid.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows bids crowded around $82.0 to $84.0, with my bid at $83.6 remaining competitive. Asks still begin at $85.0 with some sellers at this price, indicating a potential entry point. I am now placing a bid at $84.90 to approach the lowest asks.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, bids remain below $84.25 with sellers clustered at $84.95 and $85.00. I placed a bid at $84.50 to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids are clustered between $83.5 and $84.5, with asks tightly clustered at $84.88 to $84.94. I placed a bid at $84.85, just below the lowest asks, to increase competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered between $83.91 and $84.85 with my bid at $84.85 shared by Buyer Dev; asks remain tightly clustered at $84.87. I raised my bid to $84.87 to be at the lowest ask price and gain priority.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids cluster just below or at $84.85, with asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.86 matching the lowest ask to increase trade likelihood.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I observe bids clustered at or below $84.85 and asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.87 to outbid competitors and increase trade likelihood.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, bids clustered just below or at $84.85 with asks fixed at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.87 to outbid competitors and increase chances for trade execution.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue shows three buyers at $84.85 and asks fixed at $84.86 by three sellers. I placed a bid at $84.87 to keep priority and maximize trade likelihood.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, bids continue clustering at $84.85 with asks firm at $84.86. I placed a bid at $84.87 to maintain priority and maximize chances of trade execution.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered at $84.85 with asks fixed at $84.86, indicating stable seller pricing and buyer competition. Past trades mostly executed near $84.85-$84.86, with occasional lower priced trades around $82-$83. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid at $84.87 continues to secure queue priority and ensures trades near the lowest ask price while preserving decent margins. Seller rigidity suggests limited room to lower bids without risking trade loss. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $84.87 to outbid all clustered buyers and match lowest asks, maximizing trade probability and maintaining profitability.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered at $84.85, asks fixed at $84.86, indicating stable seller pricing and strong buyer competition. Trades continue to execute near $84.85-$84.87 with occasional lower priced trades rare. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at $84.87 effectively secures priority and trade execution near lowest ask with good margin. Sellers show price rigidity, limiting downward bid flexibility. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.87 to keep queue priority and trade likelihood high while preserving profitability. Watch ask prices for changes to adjust bids accordingly, but avoid exceeding $84.87 to protect margins given true value of $100.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Bids cluster at $84.85, asks steady at $84.86; trades consistently occur near $84.85-$84.87 with rare lower priced trades. Seller ask price remains rigid. #### Thoughts: Holding the bid at $84.87 secures priority, increases trade execution chances, and balances profit margin with market competition. Raising bid risks margin without commensurate benefit. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.87 to keep priority and secure trades near lowest ask. Monitor for any changes in ask price to adjust bids, but avoid exceeding $84.87 to preserve profitability given true value of $100.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster at $84.85, asks steady at $84.86; trades consistently occur near $84.85-$84.87. Seller ask price remains rigid and stable. #### Thoughts: Holding the bid at $84.87 secures priority, increases trade execution chances, and balances profit margin with market competition. Raising bid risks margin without commensurate benefit. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.87 to keep priority and secure trades near lowest ask. Monitor for changes in ask price or bidding behavior, but avoid exceeding $84.87 to preserve profitability given true value of $100. With limited remaining hours, focus on securing profitable trades rather than pushing for lower prices.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered at $84.85; asks fixed at $84.86; trades consistently near $84.85-$84.87. Market is stable with no downward pressure on asks. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the bid at $84.87 secures priority and optimizes trade likelihood without sacrificing margin. Increasing bid risks profitability without added benefit. Market rigidity suggests limited opportunity for better pricing. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $84.87 in Hour 14 to maintain priority and secure trades. Monitor market for any price shifts in the final hour before reassessment. Focus on maximizing profitable trades rather than aggressive margin negotiation given time constraints.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a bid slightly above the clustered bids at $84.87 has consistently secured trades without sacrificing margin. Attempts to push bids higher have not yielded better prices and risk eroding profitability. The stable ask prices and tight bid-ask spread indicate a mature, balanced market with little room for aggressive negotiation.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, the focus is on securing trades at the highest feasible margin near the current market equilibrium. I will maintain my bid at $84.87 to keep priority and maximize the likelihood of trade execution without conceding margin unnecessarily. With limited time left, withdrawing or lowering the bid risks missing profitable trades.",
  "bid": 84.87,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, bids remain clustered at $84.85 with asks firm at $84.86. I placed my bid again at $84.87 to maintain priority and maximize chances of closing profitable trades.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids persistently cluster at $84.85; asks are fixed at $84.86. Trades consistently occur around $84.85-$84.87, indicating stable market conditions. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the bid at $84.87 sustains priority and optimizes trade execution without sacrificing margin. The market shows no signs of downward pressure on asks or upward momentum on bids, limiting opportunities for better pricing. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $84.87 in this final hour to secure profitable trades and maintain priority. Avoid bid withdrawal or reduction to prevent missed opportunities, focusing on maximizing profitability within the constrained time horizon."
