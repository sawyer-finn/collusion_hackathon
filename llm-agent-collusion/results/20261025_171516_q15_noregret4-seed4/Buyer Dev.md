# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Balance bid increases to protect profit margin but aim to secure a trade before hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with no trades. The highest bid was 83.64 by Buyer Dev (me), and lowest ask was 96.27. I placed a bid at 83.70 to be the highest bidder and gauge seller response.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue remained tightly clustered around low 80s with my bid at 83.80, just above the highest buyer bid of 83.75. The ask queue remained high in mid to upper 90s with no trade execution. No successful trades were made by me or others this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-80s with my bid at 85.25, slightly above the highest bid of 85.00 by Buyer Hana. The ask queue remains high and unchanged with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained densely packed just below 85.5 with my bid placed at 85.75 to be the highest bidder. The ask queue stayed high with no signs of softening, and no trades were executed.

Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue remained tightly clustered around low 80s with my bid at 83.80, just above the highest buyer bid of 83.75. The ask queue remained high in mid to upper 90s with no trade execution. No successful trades were made by me or others this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-80s with my bid at 85.25, slightly above the highest bid of 85.00 by Buyer Hana. The ask queue remains high and unchanged with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained densely packed just below 85.5 with my bid placed at 85.75 to be the highest bidder. The ask queue stayed high with no signs of softening, and no trades were executed.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains tightly packed in the mid-85s with my bid at 85.75, sharing the highest bid position. The ask queue remains high, mostly above $94, with no trades executed.
Hour 6: Hour 6: Bid queue remains tightly clustered mid-80s; sellers maintain asks above 94; I placed a bid at 86.25 to increase competitiveness and encourage trade.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered mid-85s with highest bids near 85.75; ask queue stubbornly high above 94; no trades this hour despite highest bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm with high asks, creating a large spread; current bid insufficient to close gap and secure trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.25 to signal stronger buying intent and narrow spread moderately; maintain bid below true value to protect profit margin while improving chances of trade execution.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 7: You bought from Seller Femi at $85.12





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered mid-85s to mid-86s with my bid highest at 86.80; ask queue remains firm mostly above 94; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers still reluctant to lower asks significantly; maintaining top bid keeps trade readiness visible; large bid jumps risky given ask levels. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid slightly above highest current bid (86.5) to maintain top position and encourage ask reductions; monitor ask queue for any softening; balance bid increments with profit margin preservation given true value 100.

{
  "reflection": "My incremental increases in bids have kept me consistently as the highest bidder, which allowed me to secure a purchase at $85.12 in Hour 7. However, the ask prices remain stubbornly high, mostly above $94, preventing further trades. This suggests sellers are not yet motivated to lower their asks, possibly expecting higher bids closer to my true value of $100. I need to balance bid increases carefully to encourage sellers to lower asks without sacrificing too much profit.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "I will place a bid slightly above the highest competing bid (currently $86.75) to maintain the highest bid position and demonstrate willingness to pay more. This should put subtle pressure on sellers to reconsider their high asks. I will avoid large jumps above $86.80 to protect profit margins, given the gap between bids and asks remains wide. The goal is to stay competitive and ready to trade if sellers soften their asks in the near future.",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with no trades. The highest bid was 83.64 by Buyer Dev (me), and lowest ask was 96.27. I placed a bid at 83.70 to be the highest bidder and gauge seller response.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue remained tightly clustered around low 80s with my bid at 83.80, just above the highest buyer bid of 83.75. The ask queue remained high in mid to upper 90s with no trade execution. No successful trades were made by me or others this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-80s with my bid at 85.25, slightly above the highest bid of 85.00 by Buyer Hana. The ask queue remains high and unchanged with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained densely packed just below 85.5 with my bid placed at 85.75 to be the highest bidder. The ask queue stayed high with no signs of softening, and no trades were executed.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains tightly packed in the mid-85s with my bid at 85.75, sharing the highest bid position. The ask queue remains high, mostly above $94, with no trades executed.
Hour 6: Hour 6: Bid queue remains tightly clustered mid-80s; sellers maintain asks above 94; I placed a bid at 86.25 to increase competitiveness and encourage trade.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-85s and low 86s with my bid raised to 86.75 to take the highest position. The ask queue still shows high asks mostly above 94 with a few lower asks in the 88 range, but no trades have occurred so far this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue clustered mid-85s to mid-86s with my bid at 86.80 as highest. The ask queue held firm with prices mostly above 94. No trades occurred except my bid placement.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 7: You bought from Seller Femi at $85.12
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Noor at $86.17
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Yara at $85.45





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered mid-85s to mid-86s, my bid at 86.90 highest; ask queue remains firm above $93 with no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain reluctant to lower asks, expecting bids closer to my true value; maintaining highest bid signals readiness to trade but no ask softening yet. #### Updated Strategy: Slightly increase bid to 86.90 to maintain highest position and probe sellers for ask reductions; preserve profit margin by avoiding large bid jumps; monitor ask behavior closely to adjust strategy in coming hours.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue remained tightly clustered around low 80s with my bid at 83.80, just above the highest buyer bid of 83.75. The ask queue remained high in mid to upper 90s with no trade execution. No successful trades were made by me or others this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-80s with my bid at 85.25, slightly above the highest bid of 85.00 by Buyer Hana. The ask queue remains high and unchanged with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained densely packed just below 85.5 with my bid placed at 85.75 to be the highest bidder. The ask queue stayed high with no signs of softening, and no trades were executed.

Hour 6: Hour 6: Bid queue remains tightly clustered mid-80s; sellers maintain asks above 94; I placed a bid at 86.25 to increase competitiveness and encourage trade.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-85s and low 86s with my bid raised to 86.75 to take the highest position. The ask queue still shows high asks mostly above 94 with a few lower asks in the 88 range, but no trades have occurred so far this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue clustered mid-85s to mid-86s with my bid at 86.80 as highest. The ask queue held firm with prices mostly above 94. No trades occurred except my bid placement.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered mid-85s to low 87s, my bid at 87.10 highest; ask queue still firm above $93 with no trade activity. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain resistant, likely expecting bids closer to $100; incremental bid increases maintain leadership but do not close the bid-ask spread. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain highest bid with small incremental increases (e.g., +0.10) to signal willingness to buy without sacrificing margin; monitor for any ask softening; prepare to increase bid more aggressively if no ask price movement by next hour, balancing profitability and urgency to secure trades before Hour 15.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered mid-85s to low 87s, my bid at 87.20 highest; ask queue still firm above $93 with no trade activity this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain strong resistance, likely expecting bids much closer to $100; small bid increases maintain leadership but do not close the bid-ask spread. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain highest bid with small incremental increase (+0.10) to demonstrate willingness to buy without sacrificing margin; prepare to reassess and potentially increase bid more aggressively if no ask softening by next hour, balancing profitability and urgency as time horizon shortens toward Hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with no trades. The highest bid was 83.64 by Buyer Dev (me), and lowest ask was 96.27. I placed a bid at 83.70 to be the highest bidder and gauge seller response.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue remained tightly clustered around low 80s with my bid at 83.80, just above the highest buyer bid of 83.75. The ask queue remained high in mid to upper 90s with no trade execution. No successful trades were made by me or others this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-80s with my bid at 85.25, slightly above the highest bid of 85.00 by Buyer Hana. The ask queue remains high and unchanged with no trades this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remained densely packed just below 85.5 with my bid placed at 85.75 to be the highest bidder. The ask queue stayed high with no signs of softening, and no trades were executed.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains tightly packed in the mid-85s with my bid at 85.75, sharing the highest bid position. The ask queue remains high, mostly above $94, with no trades executed.
Hour 6: Hour 6: Bid queue remains tightly clustered mid-80s; sellers maintain asks above 94; I placed a bid at 86.25 to increase competitiveness and encourage trade.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remained clustered in the mid-85s and low 86s with my bid raised to 86.75 to take the highest position. The ask queue still shows high asks mostly above 94 with a few lower asks in the 88 range, but no trades have occurred so far this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue clustered mid-85s to mid-86s with my bid at 86.80 as highest. The ask queue held firm with prices mostly above 94. No trades occurred except my bid placement.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around mid-80s with my bid at 86.85 maintaining the highest position. The ask queue remains firm mostly above $94 with no trades executed this hour.
