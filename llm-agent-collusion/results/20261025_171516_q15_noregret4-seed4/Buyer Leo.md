# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, while the lowest ask remains high at $96.27. No trades have occurred in Hour 1.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered below $84, with the lowest asks still near $96.27. I placed a bid of $83.80, maintaining a slight increase above the highest current bid.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the ask queue remained mostly above $90 with some lower asks at $86.0 and $90.5. The highest bid was $85.0. I placed a bid of $84.30, slightly above the prior highest bids.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $85.6, slightly above the previous highest bid of $85.5 to stay competitive. The ask queue continues to hold above $90, maintaining a wide spread and no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stable below $86, ask queue remains firmly above $94.5, with no trades by me; spread remains wide and sellers are not lowering ask prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep us competitive but do not prompt sellers to reduce asks; maintaining margin is essential given the large spread. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at $85.6 to stay competitive yet profitable; do not increase bid unless ask prices drop or market conditions change; monitor for any shifts in ask or trade activity to adjust accordingly.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue is increasingly competitive with bids approaching $86.5, but ask queue remains stubbornly high above $94, maintaining a wide spread. No trades have occurred for me. #### Thoughts: Holding the bid at $85.6 maintained position but did not secure trades. A slight bid increase is justified to stay competitive without eroding profitability given the large spread. Sellers have not shown willingness to lower asks significantly. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $85.75 to improve chances of trade execution while preserving margin; monitor seller ask movements and buyer bid intensities closely in coming hours to adapt strategy; avoid overbidding early in the time horizon to preserve profitability for last hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue is highly competitive with top bids near $86.75; ask queue remains stubbornly high above $93. Sellers have not reduced asks significantly, maintaining a wide spread. No trades involving me yet. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $85.85 preserves margin while keeping me in the competitive tier. Sellers' high asks suggest reluctance to sell at lower prices, so forcing a trade now may be costly. Monitoring asks closely is critical. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $85.85 this hour to avoid price inflation, wait for ask queue to soften or for better trade opportunities. If asks drop closer to bids, consider incremental bid increases to secure trades before final hours. Avoid large bid jumps too early to preserve negotiation leverage.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains highly competitive with top bids near 86.8; ask queue holds firm above 93, maintaining a wide spread. No trades involving me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers are consistent in holding high ask prices, limiting trade opportunities. Maintaining 85.85 keeps me competitive but no trades secured, indicating sellers are not willing to lower prices. #### Updated Strategy: Continue holding bid at 85.85 this hour to preserve margin and competitive positioning. Watch for any decreases in ask prices toward mid-80s. Prepare to increment bid cautiously if asks soften in next hours to balance profits with securing trades before end of Hour 15.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highly competitive, top bids near 87.1; ask queue firm above 93, no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 85.85 kept margin but no trades; sellers not lowering prices. Slight bid increase needed to improve chances. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.00 to enhance competitiveness while preserving margin; monitor ask prices closely for any softening; be prepared to increase bids further if needed before Hour 15 to secure trades without compromising profit excessively.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains very competitive with multiple bids near or above 87.1; ask prices persist above 93, showing strong seller resistance. No trades for me yet despite several bid increases from 83.75 to 86.0. #### Thoughts: Previous conservative bid increases preserved margin but did not secure trades. Sellers have not lowered ask prices, indicating a wide bid-ask spread. Increased bid needed to position closer to upper bids and improve trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to 86.5 this hour to better compete with top buyers without sacrificing too much margin. Monitor if trade occurs; if not, prepare to increase bid closer to 87.1 or slightly above in final hour to avoid missing out completely.

{
  "reflection": "Despite increasing bids gradually up to 86.5, I have not secured any trades due to the wide spread and sellers holding firm at high ask prices above 93. This cautious approach preserved margin but missed opportunities earlier in the game. As the final hour approaches, waiting too long to bid closer to the top buyers risks missing trades altogether.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the last hour, I must prioritize securing at least one trade even if it means reducing profit margin. The highest current bids are around 87.2, so bidding at 87.25 will position me among the top bidders and increase the chance of a trade before the market closes. This bid remains below my true value of 100, balancing competitiveness with profitability.",

  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, the bid queue remains highly competitive with top bids near 87.2. I placed a bid of 87.25 to improve trade chances in the final hour. The ask queue remains firm above 93 with no immediate sellers lowering prices.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Top bids cluster near 87.2; ask prices still above 93; no trades secured by me yet. #### Thoughts: The wide spread persists, but last hour demands a more aggressive bid to capitalize on any possible trade. Staying just above highest bids (~87.2) balances competitiveness and margin preservation. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 87.25 to lead the bid queue, maximizing chance for a trade in final hour. If no trade occurs, accept zero profit but secure goods to avoid missing out completely."
