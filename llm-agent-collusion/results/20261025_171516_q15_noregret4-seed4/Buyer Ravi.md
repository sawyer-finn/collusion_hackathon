# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64 by Buyer Dev, aiming to position ourselves competitively in the bid queue while keeping profit margins intact.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $83.80, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.75, to lead the bid queue and improve chances of a trade.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the highest current bid of $84.25, to lead the bid queue and increase chances of a trade.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.50, slightly above highest current bid of $84.3, keeping a competitive position to encourage sellers to lower asks.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold ask prices near $95+, while highest bids have climbed to $85.85; no trades executed by us so far despite incremental bid rises. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases have not yet induced seller concession; a slightly more aggressive bid may signal stronger intent and pressure sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.90 to lead queue and test seller resistance; prepare to escalate bids more sharply in coming hours if no trade occurs, maintaining balance between profitability and securing trades.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64 by Buyer Dev, aiming to position ourselves competitively in the bid queue while keeping profit margins intact.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $83.80, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.75, to lead the bid queue and improve chances of a trade.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the highest current bid of $84.25, to lead the bid queue and increase chances of a trade.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.50, slightly above highest current bid of $84.3, keeping a competitive position to encourage sellers to lower asks.
Hour 5: Placed bid at $84.75, a slight increase over last hour’s $84.50, maintaining leadership in the bid queue; sellers continue asking near $95 and above with no trade triggered yet.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $85.90, slightly above the highest bid of $85.85, aiming to lead and nudge sellers towards lowering their asks or triggering a trade this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid at $86.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to prompt sellers to lower their ask prices or trigger a trade during Hour 7.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 7: You bought from Seller Yara at $86.25





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The latest trade at $86.25 suggests some seller willingness around this price, but most asks remain near mid-90s, indicating strong seller resistance. Incremental bid increases have kept us competitive but not significantly moved ask prices. #### Thoughts: A bid of $86.50 is competitive and may push sellers to lower asks or trade, balancing profit and execution risk. Sellers may be waiting for bids closer to $90, but I must avoid overpaying. #### Updated Strategy: Continue raising bids moderately above the current highest bids to lead the queue while observing seller ask adjustments; aim for trades between $86.50-$87.00 next few hours to secure some lots before price escalates further.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 7: You bought from Seller Yara at $86.25
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Ilan at $85.45
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Femi at $84.45





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The latest trade at $85.45 from Seller Ilan shows some seller willingness below $87, but most asks remain in the mid-90s, indicating seller resistance. The highest bids before this hour are around $86.75 to $86.80. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases above the highest bid have maintained leadership and secured trades but have not moved sellers significantly lower. Sellers might be waiting for bids closer to $90, but large increases would reduce profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to incrementally increase bids to maintain leadership and encourage trade execution near $87, avoiding large jumps to preserve margins, and monitor seller ask adjustments closely for any signs of weakening.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers consistently hold asks in the mid-90s, resisting downward movement despite multiple trades near $86-$87. Buyers cluster bids around $86.75-$86.80, indicating a ceiling for bids so far. Trades continue at prices below $87, showing some seller willingness to transact just under $87. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain leadership and secure trades but have limited impact on reducing seller ask prices. Sellers seem to expect bids closer to $90 before lowering asks. Maintaining bids near $87 balances trade probability and profit margins. #### Updated Strategy: Keep placing bids just above highest current bids (around $86.95) to lead the queue and secure trades, while avoiding large jumps that erode margins. Watch for any weakening in ask prices to adjust strategy accordingly.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64 by Buyer Dev, aiming to position ourselves competitively in the bid queue while keeping profit margins intact.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $83.80, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.75, to lead the bid queue and improve chances of a trade.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.30, slightly above the highest current bid of $84.25, to lead the bid queue and increase chances of a trade.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.50, slightly above highest current bid of $84.3, keeping a competitive position to encourage sellers to lower asks.
Hour 5: Placed bid at $84.75, a slight increase over last hour’s $84.50, maintaining leadership in the bid queue; sellers continue asking near $95 and above with no trade triggered yet.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $85.90, slightly above the highest bid of $85.85, aiming to lead and nudge sellers towards lowering their asks or triggering a trade this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid at $86.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to prompt sellers to lower their ask prices or trigger a trade during Hour 7.
Hour 8: Placed a bid at $86.50 this hour, maintaining leadership in the bid queue. A trade occurred at $86.25 with Seller Yara, showing some market movement but sellers' asks remain high.
Hour 9: Placed a bid at $86.90 to lead the bid queue with a slight increase over the highest current bid of $86.80, aiming to encourage sellers to lower ask prices or facilitate trades this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $86.90 to maintain leadership in the bid queue and encourage sellers to lower their asks or execute trades near this price point.
Hour 11: Placed bid at $86.85 to maintain leadership just above current highest bids and continue encouraging sellers to lower asks or trigger trades.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid at $86.95 to lead the bid queue slightly above the current highest bids. Sellers remain with ask prices mostly in the mid-90s, showing no significant reduction from prior hours.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, buyers maintained bids around $86.95 to $87.10, with Seller Noor still asking $99.0 and other asks in mid-90s. I placed a bid at $87.15 to lead the queue and continue pushing for trades without sacrificing margin.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I placed a bid at $87.20 to lead the bid queue and maintain competitive positioning. Sellers remain with ask prices in the mid-90s with no significant reduction observed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold asks mostly in mid-90s despite trades near $86-$87; bids cluster around $86.75-$87.10 with occasional increases securing trades but no ask decreases. #### Thoughts: Sellers expect bids near $90 to lower asks but we must preserve margins; leading bids near $87 maximize trade likelihood and profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Place bids slightly above highest current bid (~$87.20) to maintain leadership and secure trades while signaling readiness to transact near ceiling price; avoid large jumps that reduce margins; monitor ask price changes closely to adapt strategy in final hour.
