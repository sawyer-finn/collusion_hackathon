# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $81.70, slightly above the highest current bid of $81.61. The bid queue ranges from $81.3 to $83.7, and asks are between $96.43 and $98.66, showing a wide bid-ask spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.20, which is marginally higher than the highest bid of $84.1, aiming to stay competitive and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $84.65, slightly above the highest bid of $84.6, maintaining competitiveness while observing the lowest ask at $84.95.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.95, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.9, aiming to match the lowest ask and trigger a trade or encourage sellers to lower prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids remain clustered at $84.95 but trades happen near $84.75-$84.9; our matched bids at $84.95 haven't triggered trades. Seller asks are still high but some recent trades occurred below $84.9. #### Thoughts: Slightly lowering bid to $84.80 may better align with market-clearing prices and increase trade probability. #### Updated Strategy: Lower bid modestly to $84.80 to test seller willingness at this price, maintaining competitiveness while targeting realistic trading levels based on recent transactions.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids cluster tightly between $84.90 and $85.05, with highest at $85.05; recent trades happen mostly between $83.0 and $85.0. Seller asks remain mostly above $96 except isolated lower asks at $86.7 and $84.5-$84.9 range. Our previous bid at $84.90 was competitive but below the cluster of top bids. #### Thoughts: Matching top bid cluster at $85.00 should improve chances of securing trades without eroding margin too much given true value of $100. Sellers show no aggressive price drops but some asks near $84.5-$84.9 may be exploitable. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $85.00 to maximize likelihood of trade execution while maintaining profitable margin, and monitor seller ask behavior closely for opportunities to adjust strategy in subsequent hours.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids cluster tightly between $85.00 and $85.06, with highest at $85.06; seller asks mostly above $96 except isolated lower asks between $84.5 and $86.25. Previous bids at $85.00 placed me in top cluster but no trades yet. Recent trades occur mostly below $85.10. #### Thoughts: Increasing bid slightly above $85.06 to $85.10 may improve chances of trade execution by outbidding competitors without eroding margin excessively. Sellers show limited price drops but some lower asks near $84.5 to $84.9 are exploitable. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $85.10 to outbid current top buyers and target trades with sellers holding asks near $84.5-$84.9; watch for seller ask movement or trade activity to adjust strategy in subsequent hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.20, which is marginally higher than the highest bid of $84.1, aiming to stay competitive and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $84.65, slightly above the highest bid of $84.6, maintaining competitiveness while observing the lowest ask at $84.95.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.95, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.9, aiming to match the lowest ask and trigger a trade or encourage sellers to lower prices.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of $84.95 for Hour 5, maintaining the top bid level to match the lowest current ask price but no trade occurred as seller asks remain above $84.75.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $84.80 in Hour 6, slightly reducing from $84.95 to try to capture trades occurring near $84.75 to $84.9. Bid queue remains competitive but sellers still hold high asks.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of $84.90 this hour. Bid queue shows highest bids at $85.0 and seller asks remain high with one notable lower ask at $87.45, but no trade occurred at our bid level.
Hour 8: Placed bid of $85.00 at Hour 8, matching the highest frequent bid price cluster to improve competitiveness and increase chance for trade execution.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of $85.10 at Hour 9, slightly above the previous highest bids clustered around $85.05-$85.06. Seller asks remain mostly above $96 with a few around $86.25 and a cluster near $84.5-$84.9.
Hour 10: Placed a bid of $85.15 in Hour 10, slightly above the previous highest bids at $85.10, aiming to secure trades with sellers listing asks just above $85.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Maya at $85.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids currently cluster tightly between $85.00 and $85.10, with sellers mostly asking above $96 but some lower asks remain in the $84.87 to $85.69 range. Recent trades occur mostly below or near $85.10. #### Thoughts: Bidding at $85.10 has not yet yielded a trade, suggesting sellers are holding firm or matching trades with other buyers. Slightly increasing bid to $85.15 may improve position as top bidder and encourage trades with sellers holding asks just above $85. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.15 to outbid current top bidders and target trades with sellers having asks near $85.12 and $85.69. Monitor seller ask movements and trade outcomes to adjust bid strategy dynamically in subsequent hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Maya at $85.0
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Yara at $84.33





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids cluster tightly between $85.00 and $85.11; sellers hold asks mostly above $85.15 with some near $85.69; trades happen near $85.00-$85.10 but not above; sellers show some price firmness. #### Thoughts: Slight bid increments above $85.10 have not yet secured trades, but staying competitive is critical; sellers may be waiting for higher bids or holding firm. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $85.16 to outbid top buyers and target sellers with asks near $85.15-$85.69; maintain bids below $85.20 to preserve margin; monitor seller ask shifts and trade outcomes carefully for adaptive bid adjustments in coming hours.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Maya at $85.0
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Yara at $84.33
Hour 12: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.13





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids cluster tightly between 85.00 and 85.14; seller asks hold firm mostly above 85.14 with a few at 85.18 and 85.19, creating a narrow spread. Trades occur near 85.00-85.16 but not above. #### Thoughts: Slight bid increments have been effective at maintaining competitiveness but not at pushing sellers to lower ask prices or securing trades above 85.16. Sellers appear price firm near 85.18-85.19. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.18 to slightly outbid top buyers and target sellers with asks just above 85.17. This maintains competitive positioning while preserving margin below 85.20, balancing profit with trade execution chances in the final hours.

{
  "reflection": "In the last hour, maintaining a bid of $85.18 kept me competitive and just below seller asks at $85.19 and $85.20. However, no trades occurred at this level, indicating sellers are unlikely to lower their asks further. Incremental bid increases have helped maintain top bid status but haven't pushed sellers to accept lower prices or guaranteed trades above $85.16.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "I will maintain the bid at $85.18, to keep a leading position without sacrificing margin. This bid slightly outbids the cluster of top buyers around $85.15-$85.17 and targets the lowest seller asks near $85.19-$85.20. Given the time constraint with only one hour remaining after this, I will balance competitiveness and profitability, avoiding excessive bid increases that reduce profit.",
  "bid": 85.18,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid of $85.18 again in Hour 14, maintaining competitiveness just below the lowest seller asks near $85.19-$85.20; no immediate trades reported yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Highest bids cluster tightly between 85.00 and 85.18; seller asks remain firm mostly above 85.18 with a few at 85.19 and 85.20, reflecting a narrow bid-ask spread. Trades have occurred mostly below 85.16; sellers seem resistant to lowering asks beyond this range. #### Thoughts: Slight bid increments have maintained competitiveness and bid queue leadership but haven't yet triggered trades at or above 85.18. Sellers' price firmness suggests limited room for negotiation without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.18 to stay top in the bid queue while targeting the lowest seller asks; hold steady this hour to monitor if sellers adjust asks or if trades occur. Prepare to decide last-hour strategy based on seller flexibility and remaining time."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Bram. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids cluster tightly between 85.00 and 85.18; seller asks remain firm mostly above 85.18 with a few at 85.19 and 85.20, reflecting a narrow bid-ask spread. Trades have occurred mostly below 85.16; sellers seem resistant to lowering asks beyond this range. #### Thoughts: Slight bid increments have maintained competitiveness and bid queue leadership but haven't yet triggered trades at or above 85.18. Sellers' price firmness suggests limited room for negotiation without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.18 to stay top in the bid queue while targeting the lowest seller asks; hold steady this hour to monitor if sellers adjust asks or if trades occur. Prepare to decide last-hour strategy based on seller flexibility and remaining time.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases successfully maintained top bid positions but failed to trigger trades, as sellers held firm above 85.18-85.21. My purchases occurred mostly just below this range, securing some margin but leaving potential trades on the table. I could have tested a slightly higher bid earlier to probe seller limits, but risked margin erosion. Given sellers' firmness, a last-hour decisive move is warranted.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I will increase my bid above the current highest cluster to 85.22 to outbid Buyer Ana's 85.25 and Buyer Kai's 85.3 (who is not in the current bid queue but active previously). This should enhance the chance to transact with sellers at 85.21, balancing securing trades and preserving profit. If needed, I will not hesitate to bid close to 85.25 if sellers remain firm but avoid exceeding my true value of 100.",
  "bid": 85.22,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a bid of 85.22 to outbid the highest current bids clustered around 85.18, aiming to secure trades against sellers asking at 85.21.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue tight between 85.00 and 85.18; seller asks mostly firm above 85.18 with lowest at 85.21. Past trades mostly below 85.16. #### Thoughts: Sellers resistant to drop below 85.21, buyers clustered below 85.19. Margins narrow but opportunity to secure trades if bidding above 85.18. #### Updated Strategy: For final hour, increase bid to 85.22 to outbid highest bids and capture asks at 85.21, balancing trade execution and margin preservation. Avoid excessive bids above 85.25 to maintain profitability."
