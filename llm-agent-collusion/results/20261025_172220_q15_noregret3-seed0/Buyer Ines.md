# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the current highest bid of $83.25, in an attempt to improve position in the bid queue at Hour #1.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $84.50, raising it above the current highest bid of $84.10 to improve position in the bid queue and attempt to narrow the bid-ask spread.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.75 to outbid the highest bid of $84.6 and improve position in the bid queue.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.75, maintaining position just above the highest competing bid but below most asks, aiming to pressure sellers to reduce their prices or yield a trade.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now cluster tightly around $84.85 to $85.10; sellers maintain ask prices mostly above $84.89, limiting trade opportunities. Past trades concentrate near $84.7-$85.0. Kit and others are active buyers securing trades near this range, I have yet to trade. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases improve queue position but have yet to close the spread. Matching $85 bid aligns with competitive bids and past trade prices, potentially prompting sellers to yield. Maintaining bids below true value of $100 protects profit margin. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $85.00 to enhance competitiveness and pressure sellers. Monitor ask prices for downward movement or trade execution. Adjust bids incrementally up to $85.50 only if necessary, balancing profitability against likelihood of securing trades within remaining hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids continue clustering tightly around $85.00-$85.30; sellers maintain asks mostly above $84.5, limiting immediate trade opportunities. Recent trades mostly occur near $84.7-$85.0. I remain without trades despite maintaining competitive bids. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at $85.00 preserves profit margin and queue position. Incremental increases beyond $85.00 may be necessary if sellers lower asks closer to my bid as time runs out. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $85.00 bid this hour to retain position and observe market movement. Prepare to cautiously raise bid up to $85.50 in future hours if necessary to secure trades before Hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster around $85.00-$85.35; sellers hold asks mostly above $84.5, preventing trades with bids below $85.1. Recent trades occur near $84.7-$85.0, while my bids at $85.00 remain unfilled. #### Thoughts: Holding $85.00 bid has preserved margin but failed to secure trades. Incremental increases by competitors indicate competition for priority. To stay competitive and increase trade chances, a slight raise to $85.10 is warranted. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.10 this hour to improve queue position and apply pressure to sellers. Monitor seller ask adjustments closely; be prepared to raise bids incrementally up to $85.50 as needed in later hours to secure trades before Hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the current highest bid of $83.25, in an attempt to improve position in the bid queue at Hour #1.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $84.50, raising it above the current highest bid of $84.10 to improve position in the bid queue and attempt to narrow the bid-ask spread.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.75 to outbid the highest bid of $84.6 and improve position in the bid queue.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.75, maintaining position just above the highest competing bid but below most asks, aiming to pressure sellers to reduce their prices or yield a trade.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, I raised my bid to $84.85, slightly above the previous $84.75, aiming to improve queue priority and pressure sellers amid stable but high ask prices.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $85.00 to match the highest active bids and attempt to initiate trades amid stable ask prices mostly above $84.89.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, I maintained my bid at $85.00, matching highest bids in the queue, but there were no trades involving my bid yet. Seller asks remain significantly higher, mostly above $84.89.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, I maintained my bid at $85.00 amidst a tight cluster of bids around $85.00-$85.30 and seller asks mostly above $84.5. No trades involving my bid occurred.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, I raised my bid to $85.10 to improve priority among buyers clustered around $85.00-$85.06, aiming to enhance chances of a trade. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $84.5, with no immediate trades involving my bid.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $85.10, matching the highest competitive bids in the queue. Sellers still hold asks mostly above $85.10, with no immediate trades involving my bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster around $85.00-$85.35; sellers stick to asks mostly above $85.10, limiting trade frequency. Recent trades occur near $84.7-$85.0; my bid at $85.10 has not yet triggered trades. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.10 keeps me competitive while preserving margin. Sellers are firm at mid-85 range. Incremental increases may be needed if sellers don't lower asks. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.10 this hour to monitor seller response and maintain queue priority. Prepare to increase bids in small increments up to $85.50 in later hours to secure trades before Hour 15, balancing profitability and trade certainty.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered around $85.00-$85.35; sellers keep asks mostly above $85.10, limiting trade frequency. Recent trades hover around $84.7-$85.0, my bid at $85.10 remains competitive but not triggering trades. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.10 preserves margin and queue priority but may not be enough to secure trades soon. Sellers show resistance to lowering asks below $85.10. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.10 this hour to gauge seller reactions; plan to increase bid in small increments (e.g., $85.20) next hour if no trades occur, aiming to secure trades while managing profitability before Hour 15.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.0
Hour 13: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.18





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered near $85.10; sellers hold asks mostly above $85.14, with lowest near $85.18-$85.19. No trades occurred at my $85.10 bid last hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm but incremental bid increases might pressure them to lower asks or accept trades. Holding $85.10 is not enough to secure trades. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $85.20 this hour to improve queue priority and approach ask prices, aiming for trades before final hours; continue monitoring seller behavior for further bid adjustments.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.50, slightly above the current highest bid of $83.25, in an attempt to improve position in the bid queue at Hour #1.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $84.50, raising it above the current highest bid of $84.10 to improve position in the bid queue and attempt to narrow the bid-ask spread.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $84.75 to outbid the highest bid of $84.6 and improve position in the bid queue.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.75, maintaining position just above the highest competing bid but below most asks, aiming to pressure sellers to reduce their prices or yield a trade.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, I raised my bid to $84.85, slightly above the previous $84.75, aiming to improve queue priority and pressure sellers amid stable but high ask prices.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $85.00 to match the highest active bids and attempt to initiate trades amid stable ask prices mostly above $84.89.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, I maintained my bid at $85.00, matching highest bids in the queue, but there were no trades involving my bid yet. Seller asks remain significantly higher, mostly above $84.89.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, I maintained my bid at $85.00 amidst a tight cluster of bids around $85.00-$85.30 and seller asks mostly above $84.5. No trades involving my bid occurred.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, I raised my bid to $85.10 to improve priority among buyers clustered around $85.00-$85.06, aiming to enhance chances of a trade. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $84.5, with no immediate trades involving my bid.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $85.10, matching the highest competitive bids in the queue. Sellers still hold asks mostly above $85.10, with no immediate trades involving my bid.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, I maintained my bid at $85.10; sellers still hold asks mostly above $85.10 with no trades involving my bid this hour.
Hour 12: At Hour 12, I maintained my bid at $85.10 amidst a stable bid queue clustered around $85.00-$85.12 and seller asks mostly above $85.14. No trades involving my bid were observed.
Hour 13: At Hour 13, I raised my bid to $85.20 to outbid some buyers clustered around $85.10 and to better match the lowest seller asks near $85.18-$85.19, seeking improved trade prospects.
Hour 14: At Hour 14, I raised my bid to $85.19 to top the buyer queue and approach the lowest seller asks near $85.19. Bid queue remains tight with several buyers clustered around $85.15-$85.18, and seller asks still mostly above $85.19.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.0
Hour 13: You bought from Seller Gus at $85.18
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Lia at $85.19





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered tightly around $85.0-$85.18; sellers hold lowest asks at $85.19 and $85.20, with others significantly higher. Incremental bid increases have improved my queue priority but trades remain scarce at these levels. #### Thoughts: A minimal bid increase to $85.19 may trigger trades or force sellers to lower asks, improving chances of profitable trades near my valuation. Waiting too long risks no trades, but bidding too high reduces margins. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.19 this hour to secure top buyer position and approach lowest ask, aiming for trades before final hour. Monitor seller reaction for further bid adjustments or withdrawal if unproductive.

  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids remain clustered tightly around $85.0-$85.19; sellers hold lowest asks at $85.19 and $85.20, with others significantly higher. Incremental bid increases have improved my queue priority and secured several trades, but sellers have not lowered asks below $85.19. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $85.19 maximizes chances of last hour trades near current lowest ask without sacrificing further margins. Increasing bid further risks reducing profitability with no clear seller concession. Waiting or withdrawing now risks missing final trades. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.19 for last hour to secure potential trades close to lowest asks before market closes, balancing profitability and execution."
