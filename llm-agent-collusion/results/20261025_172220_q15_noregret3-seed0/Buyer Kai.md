# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Staying below 85 preserves profit margin while signaling seriousness. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 84.90 to pressure seller Maya and test willingness to trade. Monitor market response carefully next hour for signs of ask reduction or trade execution.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread and no trades. I placed a bid at 82.4, positioning myself slightly above some buyers but well below sellers' asks.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to 84.6, positioning myself as the highest bidder just below the lowest ask of 85.0. The bid queue remains below seller asks, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows I remain the highest bidder at 84.6 initially, competing with other bids mostly below 84.5. The lowest ask stood firm at 84.95 by Seller Maya. I increased my bid to 84.90 to narrow the gap further.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 84.95, matching the lowest ask prices of 84.94 and 84.95 to test sellers' willingness for immediate trades.

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Mia at $83.3





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding ask prices well above 85.0, but trades by Kit and others around 85.0 to 88.0 show the market clearing price is slightly above my previous bids. Matching lowest ask at 84.95 didn't trigger trades. #### Thoughts: Buyers willing to pay slightly above 85.0 are securing trades, so increasing bid beyond 85.0 may push trades without sacrificing too much margin. Sellers' lowest asks remain high, indicating sellers expect higher prices or are patient. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.10 to outbid current highest bids and signal stronger buying interest. Avoid overpaying by staying well below true value of 100.0. Monitor if this leads to trade execution or forces sellers to lower asks.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread and no trades. I placed a bid at 82.4, positioning myself slightly above some buyers but well below sellers' asks.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to 84.6, positioning myself as the highest bidder just below the lowest ask of 85.0. The bid queue remains below seller asks, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows I remain the highest bidder at 84.6 initially, competing with other bids mostly below 84.5. The lowest ask stood firm at 84.95 by Seller Maya. I increased my bid to 84.90 to narrow the gap further.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 84.95, matching the lowest ask prices of 84.94 and 84.95 to test sellers' willingness for immediate trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at 85.10, slightly above other top bids around 84.95 and 85.0. The ask queue remains high with lowest asks at 89.75 and above, except a few sellers around 94.0 to 97.5. No trades executed with my bid yet.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue topped at 84.95 with multiple buyers clustered there, and the lowest ask was 88.9. I placed a bid at 85.3, maintaining my position as the highest bidder while staying below the lowest ask.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread and no trades. I placed a bid at 82.4, positioning myself slightly above some buyers but well below sellers' asks.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to 84.6, positioning myself as the highest bidder just below the lowest ask of 85.0. The bid queue remains below seller asks, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows I remain the highest bidder at 84.6 initially, competing with other bids mostly below 84.5. The lowest ask stood firm at 84.95 by Seller Maya. I increased my bid to 84.90 to narrow the gap further.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 84.95, matching the lowest ask prices of 84.94 and 84.95 to test sellers' willingness for immediate trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at 85.10, slightly above other top bids around 84.95 and 85.0. The ask queue remains high with lowest asks at 89.75 and above, except a few sellers around 94.0 to 97.5. No trades executed with my bid yet.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue topped at 84.95 with multiple buyers clustered there, and the lowest ask was 88.9. I placed a bid at 85.3, maintaining my position as the highest bidder while staying below the lowest ask.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remains topped around 85.0 to 85.0+ with me highest at 85.3. Seller asks remain high, starting at 87.45 from Seller Kofi and above. I maintained my bid at 85.3.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, sellers remain with high asks around 86.7 and above, while buyers cluster bids just below 85.3, with me highest at 85.3. No trades occurred at or above my bid this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain significantly above current top bids, lowest ask now 86.7, buyers cluster bids around 85.0, with me highest at 85.3. No trades executed this hour at or above 85.3. #### Thoughts: Sellers still hold firm above 86.7, while buyer interest caps near 85.3; market clearing price appears between 85.3 and 86.7. Maintaining highest bid avoids losing market position. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at 85.3 to maintain dominance and pressure sellers to lower asks; avoid bid escalation for now to protect profit margins; monitor for any changes in ask prices or trade activity to adapt strategy accordingly.


# Output Format

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm above 86.25, well above top bids clustered near 85.0 to 85.06; I remain highest bidder at 85.3 with no trades above this bid this hour. #### Thoughts: Market clearing price lies between 85.3 and 86.25, sellers are not yet under pressure to reduce asks; buyers cluster below 85.1, so maintaining highest bid is key to securing future trades while protecting margins. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 85.3 to sustain market dominance without escalating price; wait for sellers to reduce asks closer to bid range or for buyer bids to rise before adjusting bid price. Maintain patience to maximize profitability while positioning for last hours of trading.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread and no trades. I placed a bid at 82.4, positioning myself slightly above some buyers but well below sellers' asks.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to 84.6, positioning myself as the highest bidder just below the lowest ask of 85.0. The bid queue remains below seller asks, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows I remain the highest bidder at 84.6 initially, competing with other bids mostly below 84.5. The lowest ask stood firm at 84.95 by Seller Maya. I increased my bid to 84.90 to narrow the gap further.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 84.95, matching the lowest ask prices of 84.94 and 84.95 to test sellers' willingness for immediate trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at 85.10, slightly above other top bids around 84.95 and 85.0. The ask queue remains high with lowest asks at 89.75 and above, except a few sellers around 94.0 to 97.5. No trades executed with my bid yet.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue topped at 84.95 with multiple buyers clustered there, and the lowest ask was 88.9. I placed a bid at 85.3, maintaining my position as the highest bidder while staying below the lowest ask.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remains topped around 85.0 to 85.0+ with me highest at 85.3. Seller asks remain high, starting at 87.45 from Seller Kofi and above. I maintained my bid at 85.3.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, sellers remain with high asks around 86.7 and above, while buyers cluster bids just below 85.3, with me highest at 85.3. No trades occurred at or above my bid this hour.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue tops at 85.06 with no bids at or above 85.3; seller asks remain high starting at 86.25 from Seller Kofi. I placed a bid at 85.3 to maintain highest bidder status.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I maintained my bid at 85.3 and remained the highest bidder. Seller asks stayed above 85.69 with no trades at or above my bid, confirming sellers' firm pricing.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks hold firm at 85.15+; buyer bids cluster below 85.11; no trades above 85.3 bid; I remain highest bidder.
#### Thoughts: Sellers are holding price; buyers hesitate to exceed ~85.1; market clearing price likely near 85.3.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.3 to keep dominance and protect margins; watch for seller ask reductions or buyer bid increases before adjusting; patience is critical to maximize profitability and prepare for last trading hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread and no trades. I placed a bid at 82.4, positioning myself slightly above some buyers but well below sellers' asks.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to 84.6, positioning myself as the highest bidder just below the lowest ask of 85.0. The bid queue remains below seller asks, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows I remain the highest bidder at 84.6 initially, competing with other bids mostly below 84.5. The lowest ask stood firm at 84.95 by Seller Maya. I increased my bid to 84.90 to narrow the gap further.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 84.95, matching the lowest ask prices of 84.94 and 84.95 to test sellers' willingness for immediate trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at 85.10, slightly above other top bids around 84.95 and 85.0. The ask queue remains high with lowest asks at 89.75 and above, except a few sellers around 94.0 to 97.5. No trades executed with my bid yet.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue topped at 84.95 with multiple buyers clustered there, and the lowest ask was 88.9. I placed a bid at 85.3, maintaining my position as the highest bidder while staying below the lowest ask.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remains topped around 85.0 to 85.0+ with me highest at 85.3. Seller asks remain high, starting at 87.45 from Seller Kofi and above. I maintained my bid at 85.3.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, sellers remain with high asks around 86.7 and above, while buyers cluster bids just below 85.3, with me highest at 85.3. No trades occurred at or above my bid this hour.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue tops at 85.06 with no bids at or above 85.3; seller asks remain high starting at 86.25 from Seller Kofi. I placed a bid at 85.3 to maintain highest bidder status.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I maintained my bid at 85.3 and remained the highest bidder. Seller asks stayed above 85.69 with no trades at or above my bid, confirming sellers' firm pricing.
Hour 11: Hour 11: Sellers maintain firm asks starting at 85.15, buyers cluster bids below 85.11, and I placed a bid at 85.3, remaining the highest bidder with no trades executed at or above my bid.
Hour 12: Hour 12: Bid queue topped at 85.12 with multiple buyers; seller asks remained mostly above 85.14 except two at 85.18 and 85.14. I bid 85.3 again to stay highest bidder with no apparent trades above my bid.

Your name is Buyer Kai. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 started with a wide bid-ask spread and no trades. I placed a bid at 82.4, positioning myself slightly above some buyers but well below sellers' asks.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to 84.6, positioning myself as the highest bidder just below the lowest ask of 85.0. The bid queue remains below seller asks, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows I remain the highest bidder at 84.6 initially, competing with other bids mostly below 84.5. The lowest ask stood firm at 84.95 by Seller Maya. I increased my bid to 84.90 to narrow the gap further.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 84.95, matching the lowest ask prices of 84.94 and 84.95 to test sellers' willingness for immediate trades.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at 85.10, slightly above other top bids around 84.95 and 85.0. The ask queue remains high with lowest asks at 89.75 and above, except a few sellers around 94.0 to 97.5. No trades executed with my bid yet.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue topped at 84.95 with multiple buyers clustered there, and the lowest ask was 88.9. I placed a bid at 85.3, maintaining my position as the highest bidder while staying below the lowest ask.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remains topped around 85.0 to 85.0+ with me highest at 85.3. Seller asks remain high, starting at 87.45 from Seller Kofi and above. I maintained my bid at 85.3.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, sellers remain with high asks around 86.7 and above, while buyers cluster bids just below 85.3, with me highest at 85.3. No trades occurred at or above my bid this hour.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue tops at 85.06 with no bids at or above 85.3; seller asks remain high starting at 86.25 from Seller Kofi. I placed a bid at 85.3 to maintain highest bidder status.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I maintained my bid at 85.3 and remained the highest bidder. Seller asks stayed above 85.69 with no trades at or above my bid, confirming sellers' firm pricing.
Hour 11: Hour 11: Sellers maintain firm asks starting at 85.15, buyers cluster bids below 85.11, and I placed a bid at 85.3, remaining the highest bidder with no trades executed at or above my bid.
Hour 12: Hour 12: Bid queue topped at 85.12 with multiple buyers; seller asks remained mostly above 85.14 except two at 85.18 and 85.14. I bid 85.3 again to stay highest bidder with no apparent trades above my bid.
Hour 13: Hour 13: Sellers hold firm asks mostly above 85.18, buyers cluster bids between 85.0 and 85.14, no trades executed at or above my bid. I placed my bid at 85.3 to stay highest bidder.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers maintain asks above 85.18; buyer bids cluster between 85.0 and 85.14; no trades at or above 85.3; I remain highest bidder. #### Thoughts: Market clearing price is below current seller asks; sellers show no sign of lowering asks; buyers hesitant to bid above 85.14. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.3 to safeguard margin and dominance; monitor for ask decreases or bid increases; avoid bidding above 85.3 to prevent eroding profit; prepare to adjust bid in final hours if market dynamics shift.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are firm at asks above 85.18; buyers cluster below 85.2; no trades at or above 85.3; I remain highest bidder. #### Thoughts: Market clearing price remains below seller asks; sellers show no willingness to lower asks; buyer bids capped near 85.15-85.18; maintaining bid at 85.3 preserves margin and dominance. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 85.3 to protect margin and maintain highest bid position; monitor market for ask decreases or buyer bid increases; avoid bidding above 85.3 to prevent margin erosion; prepare to reassess bid approach in final hour if market conditions change.

{
  "reflection": "Throughout the auction, maintaining a bid at 85.3 has kept me the highest bidder, but no trades have occurred at or above this level due to sellers' firm ask prices above 85.18. My purchases have consistently been below 85, maximizing profitability, but I have not secured any lots near the sellers' ask prices, indicating a persistent gap between buyer willingness and seller expectations. Attempts to bridge this gap with bids near 85.3 have preserved margin but failed to prompt trades at higher prices.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I should maintain my bid at 85.3 to remain the highest bidder and capitalize on any last-minute seller concessions, but avoid increasing my bid further to protect profit margins. If no trade occurs, withdrawing my bid at the end will preserve capital. Monitoring sellers for any sudden ask decrease or trade opportunities is critical, but aggressive bidding above 85.3 is not justified given the history of no trades at higher bids.",
  "bid": 85.3,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 started with my bid at 85.3, highest among buyers, sellers\u2019 lowest asks remain firm above 85.21, no trades executed at or above my bid this hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers remain firm at asks above 85.21; buyers cluster below 85.18; no trades at or above 85.3; I continue as highest bidder. #### Thoughts: Market clearing price remains below seller asks; sellers show no willingness to lower asks; buyer bids capped near 85.15-85.18; maintaining bid at 85.3 preserves margin and dominance. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 85.3 this last hour to maintain highest bid status and margin; avoid bidding above 85.3 to prevent margin erosion; watch for any seller ask reductions or trades; if no trade occurs, consider withdrawing bid post-auction to protect capital."
