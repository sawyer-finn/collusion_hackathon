# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed a wide bid-ask spread with no trades executed. I placed a bid of $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid, to position competitively while maintaining margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.75 to $84.15, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.1 to test seller response and move towards closing the spread.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $84.65, just above the highest current bid of $84.6, to test seller response and probe for potential trades near the $85 ask level.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $84.95, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.9, aiming to encourage trades near the $85 ask level or push sellers to reduce their ask prices.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $84.65, just above the highest current bid of $84.6, to test seller response and probe for potential trades near the $85 ask level.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $84.95, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.9, aiming to encourage trades near the $85 ask level or push sellers to reduce their ask prices.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $84.95, matching the highest bids to remain competitive and test seller response near the $85 level.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around $84.95, with sellers mostly asking well above $96 except a few near $88-$89. No trades have executed yet this hour. I placed a bid of $84.95 to maintain competitive positioning.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lia at $84.92





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices cluster tightly around $84.7 to $84.95 with no movement above $85; asks mostly remain high above $96 but a few outliers exist near mid-$80s to high $80s; recent trades occur near $84.9. #### Thoughts: Sellers hold firm on high asks but some moderate concessions near $85; buyers unwilling to push bid over $85 significantly; maintaining current bid supports steady trade flow and margin preservation. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $84.95 to remain competitive and encourage seller concessions near $85; avoid pushing bid higher to protect margins while ensuring trades occur; closely monitor any shifts in ask prices or trade activity.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed a wide bid-ask spread with no trades executed. I placed a bid of $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid, to position competitively while maintaining margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.75 to $84.15, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.1 to test seller response and move towards closing the spread.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $84.65, just above the highest current bid of $84.6, to test seller response and probe for potential trades near the $85 ask level.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $84.95, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.9, aiming to encourage trades near the $85 ask level or push sellers to reduce their ask prices.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $84.95, matching the highest bids to remain competitive and test seller response near the $85 level.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around $84.95, with sellers mostly asking well above $96 except a few near $88-$89. No trades have executed yet this hour. I placed a bid of $84.95 to maintain competitive positioning.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, bids remained clustered around $84.95 to $85.3 with no trade execution as sellers held asks mostly above $87 with one at $87.45. I placed a bid at $84.95 to maintain competitiveness.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lia at $84.92





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly grouped from $84.9 to $85.3, sellers holding asks mostly above $86.7, no trades this hour. Recent trades clustered near $84.9 indicate seller resistance to bids above $85. Sellers remain cautious with high asks, limiting trade execution. #### Thoughts: Sellers’ high asks create a gap above buyer bids; buyers reluctant to exceed $85, preserving margin. Maintaining bids just above $85 offers a balanced approach to attract sellers with slightly lowered asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally to $85.05 to remain competitive and signal willingness to transact. Monitor for any downward movement in ask prices near $86.7 to exploit potential trades while protecting profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I observed a wide bid-ask spread with no trades executed. I placed a bid of $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid, to position competitively while maintaining margin.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid from $83.75 to $84.15, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.1 to test seller response and move towards closing the spread.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $84.65, just above the highest current bid of $84.6, to test seller response and probe for potential trades near the $85 ask level.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $84.95, positioning just above the highest bid of $84.9, aiming to encourage trades near the $85 ask level or push sellers to reduce their ask prices.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $84.95, matching the highest bids to remain competitive and test seller response near the $85 level.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around $84.95, with sellers mostly asking well above $96 except a few near $88-$89. No trades have executed yet this hour. I placed a bid of $84.95 to maintain competitive positioning.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, bids remained clustered around $84.95 to $85.3 with no trade execution as sellers held asks mostly above $87 with one at $87.45. I placed a bid at $84.95 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, bids clustered just above $85 with no trades executed; sellers maintain high asks around $86.7 and above. I placed a bid of $85.05 to stay competitive while preserving margin.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, bids remain tightly clustered just above $85 with no trades executed yet. Sellers continue to hold asks high around $86.25 and above. I placed a bid of $85.05 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 10: Hour 10 observed bids clustered tightly from $85.0 to $85.1 with no trades executed as sellers held asks mostly above $85.12 and up to $97.31. I placed a bid of $85.10 to maintain a competitive position and encourage price convergence.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lia at $84.92





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered between $85.0–$85.1, sellers holding asks mostly from $85.12 upward with a large spread beyond $96, no trades this hour. Sellers remain cautious, not lowering asks below $85.12. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases may pressure sellers to reduce asks gradually; buyers are reluctant to exceed $85.10, preserving margin. The ask prices just above $85.0 represent a key threshold to monitor for potential trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally to $85.10 to stay competitive, signaling willingness to transact without eroding margin. Monitor for any downward movement in asks near $85.12 to exploit potential trades. Hold bids steady or increment slowly to avoid triggering aggressive price hikes from sellers.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lia at $84.92





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered between $85.0–$85.11; asks persist above $85.15 with some sellers still priced beyond $96. No trades executed this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm above my bid, possibly waiting for buyers to increase bids or sellers to reduce asks. Buyers protect margins by not exceeding $85.10. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.10 to hold competitive stance without eroding margin. Watch for downward ask adjustments near $85.15 to initiate trades. Avoid bid increases unless ask prices show willingness to drop. Prepare for incremental bid increases in later hours if spread persists.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lia at $84.92





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered around $85.10-$85.13; sellers hold firm asks just above $85.18 with no trades executed. The price gap is narrow but persistent. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear reluctant to drop asks below $85.18, buyers cautious but may need to raise bids to break the stalemate. Small increments might encourage trades without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $85.15 to test seller flexibility and possibly trigger trades. Maintain vigilance on seller ask adjustments. Prepare to further increase bids incrementally in Hours 14 and 15 if the stalemate persists, balancing margin preservation with the need to secure trades before the market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered around $85.15; sellers hold asks narrowly above $85.18, creating a persistent narrow spread with no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm at $85.18 and above; matching this ask might trigger trades without sacrificing margin. Incremental increases are necessary to close the gap before market close. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.18 to match lowest ask and prompt transactions. If no trades occur, consider raising bid further in Hour 15, balancing between margin preservation and the imperative to secure trades before the market closes.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, consistently bidding just below sellers' asks preserved margin but failed to secure trades as sellers remained firm at $85.18. Matching the sellers' lowest ask at $85.18 was a necessary step to attempt trades, but no trades occurred, indicating sellers may not lower prices further. The strategy to nudge bids closer to asks was sound but insufficient alone to close the trade gap.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With only one hour remaining, it is critical to secure a trade even if it means slightly reducing profit margin. I will increase my bid slightly above the current seller ask of $85.21 to $85.22 to outbid all competitors and encourage a transaction. This small increment balances the need to trade with preserving as much margin as possible.",
  "bid": 85.22,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 observed bids clustered around $85.18 with sellers holding asks at $85.21 and above. I placed a bid of $85.22 to outbid all current bids and test seller willingness to trade at this level.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered around $85.18; sellers remain firm at $85.21. No trade executed at bid matching $85.18. #### Thoughts: Sellers unlikely to reduce asks below $85.21; incremental bid increases needed to secure trade before market closes. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid slightly above lowest ask ($85.21) to $85.22 to surpass competitors and encourage trade in final hour, balancing margin and trade certainty."
