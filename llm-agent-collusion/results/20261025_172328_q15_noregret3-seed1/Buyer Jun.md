# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

- Bid queue top now at $84.25-84.30, our bid leading.
- Asks remain steady around $86.48-$86.49, no significant drop.
- Spread remains wide (~$2.2).

#### Thoughts
- Incremental bid increases have not yet induced sellers to lower asks.
- Sellers appear firm above $86.4, possibly waiting for bids to rise further.
- Larger bid increase needed to close spread but still below true value to protect profits.

#### Updated Strategy
- Lead bid queue with a more aggressive bid increase to $84.30.
- Pressure sellers to lower asks or trigger trades.
- Monitor ask responses closely for any downward adjustments.
- Maintain caution about bidding too close to $100 to avoid low or negative profits.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 began with a wide spread between bids and asks, no trades occurred. I placed a bid at $83.70 to lead the bid queue and probe market conditions.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows no trades again but the bid queue remains clustered just under $84, with our bid at $83.90 leading. Asks remain steady above $86.50 with the lowest ask still at $86.50 from Seller Luca.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows no trades yet, with our bid raised to $84.30 leading the bid queue. The lowest asks remain high around $86.48 to $86.49, maintaining a spread of about $2.2.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows multiple buyers bidding $84.3 and above, with the highest bids now at $84.5. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $86.4. I placed a bid at $84.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to close the spread.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at $84.6 before my bid raise; sellers still hold asks above $86.39, keeping spread wide. No trades occurred this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm, possibly waiting for bids closer to $86.4 or higher. Incremental bid increase to $84.75 tests seller resolve without sacrificing too much margin. #### Updated Strategy: Lead with $84.75 bid to signal readiness to trade higher; avoid aggressive jumps beyond this yet to maintain margin. Monitor seller ask movement closely; if spread persists, prepare to increment bid further in next hour to induce trades before final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 began with a wide spread between bids and asks, no trades occurred. I placed a bid at $83.70 to lead the bid queue and probe market conditions.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows no trades again but the bid queue remains clustered just under $84, with our bid at $83.90 leading. Asks remain steady above $86.50 with the lowest ask still at $86.50 from Seller Luca.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows no trades yet, with our bid raised to $84.30 leading the bid queue. The lowest asks remain high around $86.48 to $86.49, maintaining a spread of about $2.2.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows multiple buyers bidding $84.3 and above, with the highest bids now at $84.5. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $86.4. I placed a bid at $84.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to close the spread.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue tops at $84.6 with several buyers clustered near this level; the ask queue remains high with lowest asks above $86.39. I placed a bid at $84.75, leading the bids and probing seller willingness to reduce asks.
Hour 6: Hour #6 shows no trades again; seller asks remain high above $86.25, bid queue topped at $85.0 but our bid stayed at $84.75 leading among several similar bids.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks hold firm above $86.25; bid queue topped at $85.0, but no trades; my bid at $84.75 remains competitive but insufficient to close spread. #### Thoughts: Sellers not yet yielding, possibly waiting for bids closer to mid-$85s; maintaining bid at $84.75 signals intent but preserves margin; risk of losing trades if waiting too long. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $84.75 this hour to probe seller patience; if no seller movement next hour, increment bid cautiously closer to $85.0 to induce trades before final hours, balancing profit preservation with securing deals.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

{
  "reflection": "My bids have consistently led the queue but have failed to close the gap with seller asks, which remain stubbornly above $86.0. While maintaining bids around $84.75 to $85.0 preserved profit margins, it did not induce sellers to lower asks or prompt trades for me. This suggests sellers expect bids closer to or above $85.0 to transact.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the persistent spread and no trades secured so far, I will increase my bid slightly above the highest current bid ($85.1) to $85.15 to lead the queue and signal stronger buying intent. This marginal increase balances probing seller willingness to lower asks while still preserving some profit margin. I will monitor seller response closely next hour and be ready to further adjust if no trade occurs.",
  "bid": 85.15,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #7, I placed a bid at $85.15 to lead the bid queue and test seller ask flexibility amid stable low asks above $86.0 and strong buyer bids clustered around $85.0+. No trades occurred yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm above $86.0; bid queue topped at $85.1; no trades for me yet despite leading bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers seem unwilling to reduce asks below $86.0; buyers cluster bids around $85.0-$85.1; small bid increments may encourage sellers to drop asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $85.15 to lead queue and signal stronger buying intent; maintain balance between margin and trade likelihood; reassess next hour to decide on further increments or hold."

Hour 1: Hour #1 began with a wide spread between bids and asks, no trades occurred. I placed a bid at $83.70 to lead the bid queue and probe market conditions.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows no trades again but the bid queue remains clustered just under $84, with our bid at $83.90 leading. Asks remain steady above $86.50 with the lowest ask still at $86.50 from Seller Luca.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows no trades yet, with our bid raised to $84.30 leading the bid queue. The lowest asks remain high around $86.48 to $86.49, maintaining a spread of about $2.2.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows multiple buyers bidding $84.3 and above, with the highest bids now at $84.5. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $86.4. I placed a bid at $84.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to close the spread.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue tops at $84.6 with several buyers clustered near this level; the ask queue remains high with lowest asks above $86.39. I placed a bid at $84.75, leading the bids and probing seller willingness to reduce asks.
Hour 6: Hour #6 shows no trades again; seller asks remain high above $86.25, bid queue topped at $85.0 but our bid stayed at $84.75 leading among several similar bids.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at $85.15 to lead the bid queue and test seller ask flexibility amid stable low asks above $86.0 and strong buyer bids clustered around $85.0+. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $85.15 leading the bid queue but no trades occurred as seller asks stayed high above $86. The spread remains too wide for profitable trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 began with a wide spread between bids and asks, no trades occurred. I placed a bid at $83.70 to lead the bid queue and probe market conditions.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows no trades again but the bid queue remains clustered just under $84, with our bid at $83.90 leading. Asks remain steady above $86.50 with the lowest ask still at $86.50 from Seller Luca.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows no trades yet, with our bid raised to $84.30 leading the bid queue. The lowest asks remain high around $86.48 to $86.49, maintaining a spread of about $2.2.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows multiple buyers bidding $84.3 and above, with the highest bids now at $84.5. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $86.4. I placed a bid at $84.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to close the spread.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue tops at $84.6 with several buyers clustered near this level; the ask queue remains high with lowest asks above $86.39. I placed a bid at $84.75, leading the bids and probing seller willingness to reduce asks.
Hour 6: Hour #6 shows no trades again; seller asks remain high above $86.25, bid queue topped at $85.0 but our bid stayed at $84.75 leading among several similar bids.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at $85.15 to lead the bid queue and test seller ask flexibility amid stable low asks above $86.0 and strong buyer bids clustered around $85.0+. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $85.15 leading the bid queue but no trades occurred as seller asks stayed high above $86. The spread remains too wide for profitable trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue remained competitive with my bid at $85.15 leading. Seller asks stayed high above $86, keeping the spread wide and no trades occurred. I maintained my bid at $85.15 to test seller flexibility further.
Hour 10: Hour #10 shows bid queue topping near $85.3 but I maintained the leading bid at $85.15; seller asks remain high above $86, preserving a wide spread and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue topped at $85.3 with no trades; seller asks remain firmly above $86; spread around $1.0+ persists. #### Thoughts: Sellers not responding to incremental bid increases; maintaining bid at $85.15 avoids margin erosion and signals strong buying interest. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.15 this hour to test seller flexibility further; consider modest increase or strategic withdrawal next hour if no improvement; prioritize balance between profit margin and securing trades.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 began with a wide spread between bids and asks, no trades occurred. I placed a bid at $83.70 to lead the bid queue and probe market conditions.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows no trades again but the bid queue remains clustered just under $84, with our bid at $83.90 leading. Asks remain steady above $86.50 with the lowest ask still at $86.50 from Seller Luca.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows no trades yet, with our bid raised to $84.30 leading the bid queue. The lowest asks remain high around $86.48 to $86.49, maintaining a spread of about $2.2.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows multiple buyers bidding $84.3 and above, with the highest bids now at $84.5. Seller asks remain high, mostly above $86.4. I placed a bid at $84.50 to lead the bid queue and attempt to close the spread.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue tops at $84.6 with several buyers clustered near this level; the ask queue remains high with lowest asks above $86.39. I placed a bid at $84.75, leading the bids and probing seller willingness to reduce asks.
Hour 6: Hour #6 shows no trades again; seller asks remain high above $86.25, bid queue topped at $85.0 but our bid stayed at $84.75 leading among several similar bids.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at $85.15 to lead the bid queue and test seller ask flexibility amid stable low asks above $86.0 and strong buyer bids clustered around $85.0+. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $85.15 leading the bid queue but no trades occurred as seller asks stayed high above $86. The spread remains too wide for profitable trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue remained competitive with my bid at $85.15 leading. Seller asks stayed high above $86, keeping the spread wide and no trades occurred. I maintained my bid at $85.15 to test seller flexibility further.
Hour 10: Hour #10 shows bid queue topping near $85.3 but I maintained the leading bid at $85.15; seller asks remain high above $86, preserving a wide spread and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, the bid queue remained competitive with a top bid of $85.35, while seller asks persist well above $86, maintaining a wide spread; I placed a bid at $85.15 to lead the bid queue and continue probing seller willingness.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I withdrew my bid, leaving the bid queue led by bids between $85.0 and $85.35 while seller asks remained firmly above $86, maintaining the wide spread without trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold ask prices above $86 despite stable and competitive bids topping at $85.35; no trades occurred with bids leading at $85.15 or above. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not pressured sellers to lower asks; the persistent spread suggests sellers are confident or unwilling to negotiate downward. #### Updated Strategy: Withdraw bid this hour to test seller reaction and avoid prematurely conceding margin; monitor if sellers lower asks in response to reduced buyer aggressiveness; if no improvement next hour, prepare to increase bid aggressively towards $85.35 to secure trades before market closure.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers maintain ask prices firmly above 86 with no reaction to bid withdrawal. Bid queue remains competitive up to 85.4 with no trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers are unwilling to reduce asks despite no aggressive buyer bids, indicating strong seller confidence or inventory pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Re-enter the bid queue at 85.40 to lead bids and test seller response at this higher bid level; aim to induce trades before final hours balancing margin and trade probability. Prepare to increase bids aggressively if no trades materialize next hour.


# Output Format

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $85.15 leading the bid queue but no trades occurred as seller asks stayed high above $86. The spread remains too wide for profitable trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, the bid queue remained competitive with my bid at $85.15 leading. Seller asks stayed high above $86, keeping the spread wide and no trades occurred. I maintained my bid at $85.15 to test seller flexibility further.

Hour 11: In Hour #11, the bid queue remained competitive with a top bid of $85.35, while seller asks persist well above $86, maintaining a wide spread; I placed a bid at $85.15 to lead the bid queue and continue probing seller willingness.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I withdrew my bid, leaving the bid queue led by bids between $85.0 and $85.35 while seller asks remained firmly above $86, maintaining the wide spread without trades.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, the bid queue shows bids from 85.0 to 85.4 with my bid at 85.40 leading. Seller asks remain high above 86, mostly near 87 and above. No trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers maintain ask prices firmly above 86 despite leading buyer bid at 85.4. No trades have occurred this hour or recently. Bid queue remains competitive near 85.4. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering ask prices, indicating confidence or inventory constraints. Buyers have not yet matched seller expectations. This stalemate risks zero profitability if not broken soon. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 85.40 this hour to maintain leadership and test seller response. Prepare to increment bid in final hour to increase trade likelihood, balancing margin and volume. Avoid bid withdrawal this hour to maintain market pressure on sellers.


# Output Format

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a leading bid near 85.4 for several hours, no trades have occurred because seller asks remain stubbornly high above 86, creating a persistent wide spread.

Waiting too long has reduced the available time to react and adjust bids upwards.",

This bid balances moving closer to the true value of 100 without conceding too much profit margin. Securing at least one trade now is crucial to ensure profitability before the market closes. I will avoid withdrawing the bid to maintain market presence.",

  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain rigidly above 86, no trades have occurred with bids around 85.4. Buyer bids are competitive but insufficient to close the spread. Time is limited with only one hour left. #### Thoughts: Previous conservative bid increments failed to prompt sellers to lower asks. The stalemate risks zero profit. Increasing bid closer to seller asks is necessary to trigger trades. #### Updated Strategy: Place an aggressive bid at 85.85 this hour to lead bids and increase odds of trade execution before market closes. Avoid bid withdrawal to maintain market pressure. Prioritize securing trades even at slightly reduced margin to ensure profitability."
