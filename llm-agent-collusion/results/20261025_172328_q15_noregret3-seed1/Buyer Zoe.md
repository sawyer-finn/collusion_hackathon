# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.85, slightly above previous bid (81.46), aiming to outbid other buyers and increase chances of a trade. Market opened with bids clustered around 81.35 - 83.67 and asks significantly above 96, with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 84.05, outbidding the current top bids of 84.0. Sellers remain with asks mostly above 90, no trades yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 84.30 to outbid the current highest buyer bids of 84.25, continuing to compete aggressively for the best position while maintaining margin.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids are clustered tightly between 83.45 and 84.5 with multiple buyers at 84.5, while some sellers have lowered asks to as low as 84.75. I placed a bid at 84.55 to outbid the current top bids.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.85, slightly above previous bid (81.46), aiming to outbid other buyers and increase chances of a trade. Market opened with bids clustered around 81.35 - 83.67 and asks significantly above 96, with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed bid at 84.05, outbidding the current top bids of 84.0. Sellers remain with asks mostly above 90, no trades yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 84.30 to outbid the current highest buyer bids of 84.25, continuing to compete aggressively for the best position while maintaining margin.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids are clustered tightly between 83.45 and 84.5 with multiple buyers at 84.5, while some sellers have lowered asks to as low as 84.75. I placed a bid at 84.55 to outbid the current top bids.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids remain clustered in the 84.1 to 84.75 range while some sellers lowered asks to as low as 86.39. I placed a bid at 84.80, just above the highest bid, aiming to lead the buyer queue.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids remain clustered between 84.25 and 85.0 with our previous bid at 84.8 tying top bids, while seller asks persist above 86.25. I placed a bid at 85.10 to lead the buyer queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids tightly clustered up to 85.0 with multiple buyers at that price, sellers have lowered asks slightly to around 86.25 but still above bids; no trades for us yet. #### Thoughts: Small increments have maintained margin but insufficient to close spread; sellers not pressured enough. #### Updated Strategy: Outbid top buyers by a clear margin (85.10) this hour to lead queue and increase pressure on sellers to lower asks, potentially triggering trades and improving execution chances while preserving some profit margin.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain clustered at 85.0 and 85.1; seller asks show minimal decrease with lowest ask at 85.25; no trades involving me yet despite leading bid. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 85.1 sustains queue leadership but large ask-bid spread persists; sellers not incentivized to lower asks yet. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 85.1 for this hour to maintain top position and test seller willingness to reduce asks; reassess in Hour 9 whether to incrementally increase or withdraw based on market movement to balance profit and trade execution.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Aiko at $85.32





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids are tightly clustered around 85.0-85.3, sellers hold asks above 85.17, maintaining a significant spread; no trades involving me yet despite leadership attempts. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm on asks, likely expecting prices closer to 86 or higher; current bid levels insufficient to trigger trades; maintaining leadership without execution risks missing trade opportunities as deadline nears. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid incrementally to 85.35 this hour to regain leadership and pressure sellers; monitor seller ask adjustments; if no trades occur, prepare to increment bids further or withdraw to recalibrate as time horizon shortens toward Hour 15.

#### Observations: Buyer bids tightly clustered at 85.0-85.35, seller asks remain firm above 85.17, minimal trade activity involving me despite leadership. #### Thoughts: Sellers have not softened on price, maintaining a spread that limits trades; maintaining leadership with bids just above 85.3 has not triggered significant seller concessions. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 85.40 this hour to regain leadership and pressure sellers; monitor seller ask adjustments closely; prepare to increment bids further in small steps or consider bid withdrawal if no progress by Hour 13 as deadline approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids remain clustered in the 84.1 to 84.75 range while some sellers lowered asks to as low as 86.39. I placed a bid at 84.80, just above the highest bid, aiming to lead the buyer queue.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids remain clustered between 84.25 and 85.0 with our previous bid at 84.8 tying top bids, while seller asks persist above 86.25. I placed a bid at 85.10 to lead the buyer queue.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, I maintained a bid at 85.10, continuing to lead the buyer queue. Seller asks remain above 86.0, with no trades executed involving me yet.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple buyers at 85.0 and 85.1, and seller asks still above 85.25, showing no significant price concessions. I placed a bid at 85.1 to maintain leadership and monitor seller response.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue remains tightly clustered just above 85.0 with multiple buyers competing; seller asks still hold above 85.25 with no trades involving me. I placed a bid at 85.1 to maintain leadership and test seller willingness to lower asks.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, I placed a bid at 85.35 to outbid the current highest buyer bid of 85.3 and attempt to lead the queue; sellers maintain asks above 85.17 with no trades involving me yet.
Hour 11: Placed a bid at 85.40 to outbid the current highest buyer bid of 85.35 and test seller willingness to lower asks or accept a trade.
Hour 12: Placed a bid at 85.40 to maintain competitiveness and monitor seller responses in Hour 12.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Aiko at $85.32
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Hana at $84.45
Hour 12: You bought from Seller Sami at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain tightly clustered between 85.0 and 85.4, seller asks persist above 85.17, limiting trade volume. Recent trades at ~85.3 to 84.4 suggest willingness to transact near current bid levels but sellers are not conceding significantly. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain leadership but risk eroding margin without triggering seller ask reductions. Sellers remain patient. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.40 this hour to test seller willingness to trade; if no progress by Hour 13, consider slight further increases or strategic bid withdrawal to preserve margin and reassess market dynamics for the final stretch.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Aiko at $85.32
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Hana at $84.45
Hour 12: You bought from Seller Sami at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain clustered tightly between 85.0 and 85.4, seller asks remain above 86.0, limiting trades and price concessions. Recent trades show sellers willing to transact near 84.4-85.4 but no further ask reductions. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the current bid leadership tests seller patience without eroding margin significantly. Sellers show strong resistance to lowering asks, suggesting patience in market. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with bid at 85.40 this hour to sustain buy queue leadership and monitor seller responses; if no movement by Hour 14, consider a slight increase to 85.50 or bid withdrawal to protect margins and reassess for final bidding hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Aiko at $85.32
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Hana at $84.45
Hour 12: You bought from Seller Sami at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain tightly clustered between 85.25 and 85.4; sellers maintain asks above 86.0, resulting in limited price concessions and fewer trades at lower prices. Recent trades confirm sellers' reluctance to drop asks below 85.4-86.0 range. #### Thoughts: Holding steady at 85.40 keeps me competitive without sacrificing margin prematurely; sellers may be waiting to test buyer willingness to increase bids. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with bid at 85.40 this hour to maintain queue leadership and monitor seller ask movement; if no downward movement by Hour 15, prepare to either increase bid slightly to 85.50 or withdraw bid to protect margins while reassessing final hour tactics.
