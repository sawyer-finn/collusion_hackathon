# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between 84.0 and 85.2 with our bid at the top; lowest asks still high at 88.95 and above, no trades this hour. Sellers remain resistant to price drops despite leading bids. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain market leadership but do not induce trades or ask reductions yet. Sellers likely waiting for bids to rise further. Wide bid-ask spread persists. #### Updated Strategy: Slightly increase bid to 85.25 to signal stronger demand while preserving margin, monitor for seller reactions or trades. Continue cautious approach to balance profit and trade likelihood in the near term.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between 84.0 and 85.3 with my bid sharing the lead; lowest asks remain high at 88.95 and above; no trades this hour. Sellers show strong resistance to lowering prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have maintained market leadership but not induced trades or ask price reductions. Market appears segmented with sellers holding out for much higher prices. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.30 to signal steady demand without sacrificing margin prematurely. Monitor seller behavior closely next hour before increasing bids further, balancing the need for trades with profitability as the time horizon shortens.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at 85.30 for top buyers; lowest asks stay firm at 88.95 and above; no trades for the hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not budging on ask prices despite steady top bids; incremental bid increases have failed to trigger trades or ask reductions. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.30 to signal consistent demand without reducing margin; observe market response and trades in next hour before considering higher bids; balance trade execution urgency with profitability given limited time remaining.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at 85.30; lowest ask stable at 88.95; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers holding firm despite steady top bids; incremental bid increases have not triggered ask reduction or trades; margin preservation still key. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 85.30 to maintain market presence and avoid margin erosion; wait for ask price to soften before increasing bid; prepare to escalate bids closer to hour 15 if no trades occur to secure at least one trade while balancing profitability.


# Output Format

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Pioneer Automotive as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 14: You bought from Seller Omar at $84.75





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered around 85.30 to 85.55; lowest ask stable at 88.95; no trades despite several high bids; successful trades happen below 86 but asks remain high. #### Thoughts: Sellers unwilling to reduce asks below 88.95; incremental bid increases below 85.5 insufficient to trigger trades; market is tight but time is short. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid more aggressively to 86.00 to outbid top buyers and signal stronger interest. This may induce sellers to lower asks or lead to trades. Prepare to further increase bids in final hour if needed to secure at least one trade, balancing profit margin and execution urgency.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "Previous incremental bids below 86.00 did not induce trades or force sellers to lower asks. Waiting too long to increase bids closer to my true value limited opportunities for profitable trades. Early more aggressive bidding could have increased chances of concluding deals.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I will increase my bid to 87.00, which is above all current buyers but still below my true value of 100.00. This is an aggressive move designed to secure a trade this hour while maintaining a profit margin.",
  "bid": 87.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a bid at 87.00 to outbid all other buyers and signal strong buying interest to sellers in an attempt to secure a trade before the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered just below 86.00; lowest asks are significantly higher, around 93.75 to 97.39; trades occur below 86 but no trades at current ask levels; sellers have not lowered asks despite buyer persistence. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm on high asks, likely expecting higher bids in the final hours; previous conservative bids failed to close trades; time is critical now. #### Updated Strategy: In final hour, raise bid aggressively above top buyers to 87.00 to maximize chance of trade while preserving margin; if trade not executed, no further opportunities exist."
