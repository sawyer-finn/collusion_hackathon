# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Highest current bid is 83.59, lowest ask is 96.32, a wide spread preventing immediate trades.
- Market is just opening; no trades yet.

#### Thoughts
- Bids currently well below true value of 100.00.
- Sellers' asks are still quite high; need to gauge if they will lower asks over time.
- Positioning a bid just above the highest buyer may increase chances of trade without sacrificing too much profit.

#### Updated Strategy
- Place a bid slightly above the highest current bid to signal buying interest.
- Monitor how ask prices evolve, especially if they start to converge with bids.
- Gradually increase bid price over subsequent hours if no trades occur, balancing profit margins and trade likelihood.
- Avoid aggressive bids too early to preserve profit potential.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.60, slightly above the highest current bid of 83.59, aiming to improve chances of securing a trade while maintaining a profitable margin relative to the true value of 100.00.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at 83.80, slightly above highest buyer bids at 83.70, aiming to improve chances of a trade while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 84.10, just above the highest bid of 84.05, aiming to maintain a competitive position and encourage sellers to lower their asks.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows dense buyer activity around 84.1 to 85.05, while ask prices remain high, starting at 91.5. I placed a bid at 84.10 again, maintaining a strong competitive stance.

Hour 6: Placed a bid at 84.75 this hour, positioning slightly below top buyers clustered at 85.0-85.25, while sellers' asks remain stubbornly high above 88.95 with no trades involving me yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered between 84.0 and 85.25; ask prices stubbornly high, with a lowest ask at 88.95, well above bids; no trade for me yet despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yet incentivized to lower asks; bids near 85.0 may encourage price movement eventually; need to balance competitive bidding and profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to 84.75 to remain competitive just below the highest bids, monitor for any lowering in asks or trade opportunities, and be ready to adjust bidding more aggressively in later hours if no trades occur.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered tightly between 84.0 and 85.3 with many buyers bidding 85.0 or slightly above; sellers' asks persistently high with the lowest ask at 88.95; no trades involving me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers have not responded to incremental bid increases, indicating strong ask resistance; maintaining bids at 85.0 keeps competitive position but does not yet trigger trades or ask drops; market appears sticky on the ask side. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 85.0 to stay competitive without eroding profit margin; closely monitor sellers' response; consider more aggressive bid increases in future hours if no trade occurs to balance trade execution urgency with profitability as final hour approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.60, slightly above the highest current bid of 83.59, aiming to improve chances of securing a trade while maintaining a profitable margin relative to the true value of 100.00.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at 83.80, slightly above highest buyer bids at 83.70, aiming to improve chances of a trade while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 84.10, just above the highest bid of 84.05, aiming to maintain a competitive position and encourage sellers to lower their asks.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows dense buyer activity around 84.1 to 85.05, while ask prices remain high, starting at 91.5. I placed a bid at 84.10 again, maintaining a strong competitive stance.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at 84.50 this hour, slightly above the previous 84.10 to stay competitive and potentially encourage sellers to lower asks or execute a trade.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at 84.75 this hour, positioning slightly below top buyers clustered at 85.0-85.25, while sellers' asks remain stubbornly high above 88.95 with no trades involving me yet.
Hour 7: Placed a bid at 85.00 this hour, aligning with the highest current bids to strengthen my position in the queue and encourage potential trades as sellers' asks remain above 88.95.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, sellers' asks remain high with the lowest ask at 88.95, and the bid queue is clustered tightly at 85.0 and above. I placed a bid at 85.0 to maintain a strong competitive position among top buyers.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, sellers' asks remained high with the lowest ask still at 88.95, while the bid queue was tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.3. I placed a bid at 85.00, maintaining my competitive position but no trades involving me occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between 85.0 and 85.3 with many buyers at 85.0; sellers' lowest ask is steady at 88.95; no trades involving me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not lowering asks despite competitive bids; maintaining bids at 85.0 retains profitability and queue position; market remains sticky on ask side. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 85.0 to sustain competitiveness and margin; monitor seller behavior and trade activity for shifts; prepare to increment bids moderately if no trades occur in next hours to balance urgency with profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 9: At Hour 9, sellers' asks remained high with the lowest ask still at 88.95, while the bid queue was tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.3. I placed a bid at 85.00, maintaining my competitive position but no trades involving me occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller ask prices remain firmly above 88.95; bid queue remains tightly clustered around 85.0-85.3; no trades involving me despite stable bids; other buyers incrementally increasing bids have not shifted seller behavior.
#### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering prices; maintaining 85.0 protects margin and queue position; incremental bid increases by others ineffective so far; time horizon shortening but sellers remain firm.
#### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at 85.0 this hour to conserve profit potential and maintain queue rank; closely watch for any ask price changes or trades; prepare to raise bid moderately in next hours if no trades occur to avoid missing opportunities as deadline approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' ask prices remain steady above 88.95; bid queue remains tightly clustered between 85.0 and 85.5; no trades involving me despite stable and incremental bid increases by other buyers; time horizon is shortening with only two hours remaining.
#### Thoughts: Seller resistance to price decrease is strong; incremental bid increases by buyers have not yet triggered seller concessions or trades; maintaining 85.0 preserved margin but risks missing trades; 85.30 is still well below seller asks and below true value, offering a good balance.
#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to 85.30 this hour to improve queue position and chances of trade, while preserving profitability; monitor seller ask changes closely; prepare for further moderate bid increases if no trade occurs next hour, balancing profit margin and urgency.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Tara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 83.60, slightly above the highest current bid of 83.59, aiming to improve chances of securing a trade while maintaining a profitable margin relative to the true value of 100.00.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at 83.80, slightly above highest buyer bids at 83.70, aiming to improve chances of a trade while maintaining margin.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 84.10, just above the highest bid of 84.05, aiming to maintain a competitive position and encourage sellers to lower their asks.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows dense buyer activity around 84.1 to 85.05, while ask prices remain high, starting at 91.5. I placed a bid at 84.10 again, maintaining a strong competitive stance.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at 84.50 this hour, slightly above the previous 84.10 to stay competitive and potentially encourage sellers to lower asks or execute a trade.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at 84.75 this hour, positioning slightly below top buyers clustered at 85.0-85.25, while sellers' asks remain stubbornly high above 88.95 with no trades involving me yet.
Hour 7: Placed a bid at 85.00 this hour, aligning with the highest current bids to strengthen my position in the queue and encourage potential trades as sellers' asks remain above 88.95.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, sellers' asks remain high with the lowest ask at 88.95, and the bid queue is clustered tightly at 85.0 and above. I placed a bid at 85.0 to maintain a strong competitive position among top buyers.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, sellers' asks remained high with the lowest ask still at 88.95, while the bid queue was tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.3. I placed a bid at 85.00, maintaining my competitive position but no trades involving me occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, sellers' lowest ask remained at 88.95 with no decrease, while the bid queue stayed clustered at 85.0 and above. I placed a bid at 85.0 to maintain my competitive position.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.3, and seller asks hold steady at 88.95 and above. I placed a bid at 85.0 to maintain my competitive position and profitability.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, seller asks remained above 88.95 with no reduction, and the bid queue was still tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.3. I placed a bid at 85.00 to maintain my competitive position and profit margin.
Hour 13: Placed a bid at 85.30 in Hour 13 to enhance competitiveness while observing sellers still holding ask prices above 88.95 with no trades involving me yet.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I placed a bid at 85.30 matching the higher competitive bids; seller asks remain above 88.95 with no reduction, and no trades involving me occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks still firmly above 88.95; bid queue tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.6; no trades involving me despite competitive bidding; time horizon is now very short with only one hour left after this.
#### Thoughts: Sellers show strong price resistance; maintaining 85.30 balances competitiveness and margin; risk of no trades if bids remain too low.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.30 this hour to stay competitive and preserve profit; closely monitor seller ask changes; prepare to increase bid more aggressively in final hour if no trade occurs this hour.
