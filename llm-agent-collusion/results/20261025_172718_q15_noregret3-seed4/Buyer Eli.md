# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Increasing my bid to $84.50 improves my queue position without overpaying early. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $84.50 to climb the queue. Monitor if sellers lower asks closer to bids. Prepare to increase bids further in subsequent hours to secure trades before Hour #15, balancing profitability and trade likelihood.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 saw a bid queue clustered between $81.27 and $83.64, with my bid at $82.34. The ask queue started at $98.71 and descended to $96.27, showing a large spread and no trades yet. I raised my bid to $82.50 this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered in the low to mid $80s with my bid raised slightly to $83.00. The ask queue stayed high near $96-$97 with no trades taking place.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, asks remain high near $96-$97 except one outlier at $89.0 while bids cluster between $83.0 and $85.25. I raised my bid to $84.50, moving up in the queue but still below the top bids.
Hour 4: Hour #4 shows bids clustered between $84.25 and $88.5 with my bid raised to $85.75, and asks descending to a low of $89.5. No trades occurred this hour.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 saw a bid queue clustered between $81.27 and $83.64, with my bid at $82.34. The ask queue started at $98.71 and descended to $96.27, showing a large spread and no trades yet. I raised my bid to $82.50 this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered in the low to mid $80s with my bid raised slightly to $83.00. The ask queue stayed high near $96-$97 with no trades taking place.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, asks remain high near $96-$97 except one outlier at $89.0 while bids cluster between $83.0 and $85.25. I raised my bid to $84.50, moving up in the queue but still below the top bids.
Hour 4: Hour #4 shows bids clustered between $84.25 and $88.5 with my bid raised to $85.75, and asks descending to a low of $89.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows strong clustering just below $86 with my bid now at $85.80. The ask queue remains well above $89.5, maintaining a wide spread. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 6: Hour #6 shows the bid queue top clustering around $85.5 to $85.95 with my bid at $85.85. The ask queue remains high with the lowest ask still near $94.92, resulting in no trades this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids cluster near $85.5-$85.95 with my bid now $85.85; ask queue lowest remains high around $94.92; no trades for me yet; spread still very wide. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but sellers are not lowering asks; wide spread suggests sellers expect higher prices or buyers are cautious. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain slight bid increase to $85.85 this hour to stay competitive; avoid large jumps that reduce profit margin; closely monitor any ask price reductions or trade activity; plan to adjust strategy if no change in spread after next hour or if sellers lower asks closer to $86.


# Output Format

Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remained clustered in the low to mid $80s with my bid raised slightly to $83.00. The ask queue stayed high near $96-$97 with no trades taking place.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, asks remain high near $96-$97 except one outlier at $89.0 while bids cluster between $83.0 and $85.25. I raised my bid to $84.50, moving up in the queue but still below the top bids.
Hour 4: Hour #4 shows bids clustered between $84.25 and $88.5 with my bid raised to $85.75, and asks descending to a low of $89.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows strong clustering just below $86 with my bid now at $85.80. The ask queue remains well above $89.5, maintaining a wide spread. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 6: Hour #6 shows the bid queue top clustering around $85.5 to $85.95 with my bid at $85.85. The ask queue remains high with the lowest ask still near $94.92, resulting in no trades this hour.
Hour 7: Hour #7 shows bid queue top clustering from $85.6 to $86.3 with my bid steady at $85.85; ask queue remains high with lowest asks around $94.91; no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Hour #8 bid queue top remains clustered near $85.6-$86.3; my bid stays at $85.85; ask queue lowest remains high near $94.9; no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids cluster near $85.6-$86.3 with my bid steady at $85.85; ask queue lowest remains near $94.9; no trades this hour; spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases sustain competitiveness but no downward movement in asks suggests sellers expect higher prices; buyers hesitant to bid above $86.3, creating a persistent spread. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.85 to keep a strong position without eroding margin; monitor for any ask price reductions or trades; prepare to reassess bidding strategy if no progress after next hour; consider withdrawal or more aggressive bidding as deadline approaches to avoid missing trade opportunities.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: At Hour #3, asks remain high near $96-$97 except one outlier at $89.0 while bids cluster between $83.0 and $85.25. I raised my bid to $84.50, moving up in the queue but still below the top bids.
Hour 4: Hour #4 shows bids clustered between $84.25 and $88.5 with my bid raised to $85.75, and asks descending to a low of $89.5. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows strong clustering just below $86 with my bid now at $85.80. The ask queue remains well above $89.5, maintaining a wide spread. No trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids steady near $85.85-$86.4; ask queue lowest remains high near $94.88-$96.08; no trades this hour; spread remains wide; sellers firmly resist dropping prices. #### Thoughts: Market remains stalled with buyers capped near $86.4 and sellers not reducing asks; maintaining bid avoids margin erosion but limits trade probability; seller resistance strong. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.85 to preserve competitiveness and margin; monitor for any ask drops; prepare to incrementally increase bid toward $86.25 or higher in coming hours if no trade occurs, balancing profitability with urgency as hour #15 approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids remain clustered near $85.6-$86.5, with sellers still firm at $94.85-$96.08; no trades again this hour; other buyers are bidding at or above my level. #### Thoughts: Market is locked in a stalemate with wide spread and seller resistance; holding bid at $85.85 did not yield any trades; time is becoming critical with only 3 hours left; slight bid increments are necessary to improve competitive position without losing significant margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $86.25 this hour to move closer to top bids and gain priority; monitor for any ask price reductions; prepare to increment bids further next hour if no trade occurs; remain cautious to avoid unnecessary margin erosion while increasing trade probability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.
