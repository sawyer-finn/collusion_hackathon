# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.

#### Observations
- Opening bids cluster between $81.27 and $83.64.
- Asks are significantly higher, between $96.27 and $98.71.
- No trades yet, indicating a wide bid-ask spread.

#### Thoughts
- The market is in early stages; sellers' ask prices are high relative to buyers' bids.
- Placing a bid just above the highest current buyer bid can improve queue priority.
- True value is $100, so there's room to increase bids in later hours if necessary.

#### Updated Strategy
- Start with competitive but conservative bids just above highest buyer bids.
- Monitor ask price movements for potential narrowing of the spread.
- Avoid overbidding early to preserve profit margin.
- Adjust bids upward gradually in later hours to increase chances of trades as time runs out.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.70 in Hour #1, slightly above previous bids around $83.64 but still below the seller asks near $98. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $85.25, slightly higher than the previous highest bid of $85.00, while seller asks remain above $95. No trades occurred again this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $85.50 in Hour #3, slightly above the highest bids of $85.25. Seller asks remain mostly above $94.99 with one outlier at $89.00. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, seller asks remain mostly above $94.94 except for one at $89.50. Buyer bids cluster at $85.5 with a few slightly higher bids, including mine at $85.50. No trades have occurred yet. I placed a bid at $85.50.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Ilan at $86.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain mostly above $94.9 with no significant drop this hour; buyer bids cluster around 85.5 to 86.25, with some pushing higher. No trades involving me yet. #### Thoughts: Increasing bid to $86.30 to lead buyer bids and prepare for potential seller ask reductions closer to this level. Must avoid bidding too high to maintain profit margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increment bid slightly above highest current bid to stay competitive, monitor seller ask movements closely, and be prepared to adjust bids or withdraw if no downward movement in asks occurs. Focus on balancing competitiveness with profit preservation.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Ilan at $86.15
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Femi at $85.17





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain high above $94.9 with no concessions; buyer bids cluster just below $86.35. Recent trades occurred around $85-$86.15. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid marginally above the highest bid sustains competitiveness without eroding profit margins excessively. Sellers have not lowered asks near my bid range, indicating a need for patience and strategic bidding. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid slightly above the current highest bid ($86.3) to keep top buyer position. Monitor seller ask movements closely. If sellers stay firm above $94.9, consider withdrawing bids in upcoming hours to protect margins and wait for better trading opportunities.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Ilan at $86.15
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Femi at $85.17
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Noor at $85.97





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm above $94.88 with no reductions; buyer bids cluster just below or at $86.4. Successful trades continue around $85-$86.15, confirming market resistance at this level. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid just above $86.4 retains best buyer position without compromising margins. Sellers show no incentives to drop ask prices, indicating patience is required. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $86.45 to secure top position and trades at reasonable prices. Monitor for any ask price softening. Avoid overbidding beyond $86.45 until sellers show willingness to lower asks closer to buyer bids.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.70 in Hour #1, slightly above previous bids around $83.64 but still below the seller asks near $98. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $85.25, slightly higher than the previous highest bid of $85.00, while seller asks remain above $95. No trades occurred again this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at $85.50 in Hour #3, slightly above the highest bids of $85.25. Seller asks remain mostly above $94.99 with one outlier at $89.00. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, seller asks remain mostly above $94.94 except for one at $89.50. Buyer bids cluster at $85.5 with a few slightly higher bids, including mine at $85.50. No trades have occurred yet. I placed a bid at $85.50.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, seller asks remain mostly above $91.5 with some at $83.0 and $83.5. Buyer bids cluster from $85.2 to $85.75, with me placing a bid at $85.80 to stay slightly ahead.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at $86.30 to slightly outbid the current highest bids and position myself for potential trades if sellers lower their asks.
Hour 7: Placed a bid at $86.35 in Hour 7, slightly above the highest current bids. Seller asks remain mostly above $94.9 with no significant decrease, and buyer bids cluster below $86.35.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, seller asks remain above $94.9 with no significant decrease. Buyer bids cluster up to $86.3; I placed a bid at $86.35 to stay marginally ahead, maintaining a competitive position.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, seller asks stayed above $94.89 and buyer bids clustered up to $86.4. I placed a bid at $86.45 to stay slightly ahead of other buyers.
Hour 10: Placed bid at $86.45, slightly above the highest current bid of $86.4; seller asks remain unchanged above $94.88, no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 11: Placed a bid at 86.50 to remain the highest buyer bid and monitor seller ask behavior which remains unchanged above 94.87 this hour.
Hour 12: Hour 12 sees seller asks still firmly above 94.86, buyer bids cluster up to 86.5, and I maintain my highest bid at 86.50 to remain competitive and ready to trade.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain consistently above 94.86 with no signs of lowering; buyer bids cluster up to 86.5 with some aggressive buyers but no trades above 86.5; previous trades completed near 85-86.15 range. #### Thoughts: Sellers are patient and holding firm with ask prices well above bids; buyers have not moved aggressively beyond 86.5; maintaining highest bid helps secure trades but pushing beyond 86.5 risks margin erosion. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.50 to stay highest bidder and ready for trades; avoid raising bid unless seller asks soften significantly; monitor market for any shifts, especially in seller asks, in last hours to adjust bidding aggressively if opportunity arises; balance securing trades and protecting profit margins carefully as end of trading horizon approaches.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Ilan at $86.15
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Femi at $85.17
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Noor at $85.97





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain stable above 94.85; no drop in ask prices observed; buyer bids max out at 86.5 with a few buyers matching this bid; no trades occurred this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are very patient, holding firm at high ask prices; buyers are unwilling to push beyond 86.5 likely due to margin concerns; maintaining bid at 86.50 keeps me competitive without margin loss. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid steady at 86.50 to stay highest bidder and ready to trade; do not increase bid unless seller asks decrease significantly, which has not occurred; monitor closely for any shifts in seller strategies in the final hours; balance securing trades and protecting margins as the trading horizon narrows.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "reflection": "Throughout the auction, seller asks have remained stubbornly high around $94.8+, preventing trades at my bid range near $86.5. My incremental bid increases successfully kept me as the highest bidder, but no trades occurred in recent hours, indicating a strong seller resistance and buyer reluctance to push prices higher given the large spread. I could have explored an earlier strategy to test slightly higher bids to pressure sellers, but the persistent wide ask spread limited opportunities.",

Sellers have shown no indication of lowering asks below $94.8, which is far above my value of $100 but well above my current bid range. Incrementally raising my bid above $86.50 risks eroding profit unnecessarily with uncertain chance of meeting seller asks.
