# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $83.70, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to position well in the queue while maintaining profitability margin. No trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.10, slightly above previous $83.70, to improve competitiveness. Market still shows wide spread with asks around $95-$97 and no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $85.30, slightly above the highest bids clustered at $85.25. Observed that the lowest ask remains at $89 from Seller Ilan, with other asks still high around $95-$96.
Hour 4: Observed bid queue dense around $85.3-$85.5 with some buyers pushing to $85.6 and one buyer at $88.5. Lowest ask remains high at $89.5. I placed a bid of $85.6 to improve queue position and signal willingness to trade without sacrificing profit.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains dense between $85.5-$86.25 with outliers at $87.0 and higher; lowest asks stubbornly remain above $94.9 with no downward movement; no trades triggered near $85.6 despite steady bidding. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear to have overvalued asks or are unwilling to lower below mid-$90s; bid increments above $86 risk margin erosion; patience may encourage sellers to reduce asks. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.6 to hold competitive queue position while protecting profit margin; monitor for any ask reductions; prepare to increment bid cautiously only if ask prices move closer to $90 or below.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $83.70, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to position well in the queue while maintaining profitability margin. No trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.10, slightly above previous $83.70, to improve competitiveness. Market still shows wide spread with asks around $95-$97 and no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $85.30, slightly above the highest bids clustered at $85.25. Observed that the lowest ask remains at $89 from Seller Ilan, with other asks still high around $95-$96.
Hour 4: Observed bid queue dense around $85.3-$85.5 with some buyers pushing to $85.6 and one buyer at $88.5. Lowest ask remains high at $89.5. I placed a bid of $85.6 to improve queue position and signal willingness to trade without sacrificing profit.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of $85.6 again to maintain competitiveness; observed that asks remain stubbornly high above $91.5 with no trades triggered near our bid.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, I maintained my bid at $85.6, observing the bid queue still tightly clustered between $85.5 and $86.25 and asks persistently high around $94.9 and above. No trades occurred near my bid this hour.
Hour 7: Maintained bid at 85.6 with bid queue dense between 85.6 and 86.3, asks remain high around 94.9 to 96.79, no trades executed this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue persists dense mostly between 85.6 and 86.3, asks remain high near 94.9 or more, no trades near highest bids but trades occur near 83.5 to 86.25. Sellers unwilling to lower asks significantly; spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Holding high bids has not triggered trades; lowering bid closer to recent trade prices may increase execution chances without eroding too much profit. Sellers may be waiting for better bids or to hold prices high. #### Updated Strategy: Lower bid slightly to 85.3 to align with recent trade prices and encourage trade; monitor if asks drop closer to 90; gradually increase if market shows downward movement in asks; prioritize securing trades now over holding maximum margin due to limited remaining time horizon.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $83.70, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to position well in the queue while maintaining profitability margin. No trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.10, slightly above previous $83.70, to improve competitiveness. Market still shows wide spread with asks around $95-$97 and no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $85.30, slightly above the highest bids clustered at $85.25. Observed that the lowest ask remains at $89 from Seller Ilan, with other asks still high around $95-$96.
Hour 4: Observed bid queue dense around $85.3-$85.5 with some buyers pushing to $85.6 and one buyer at $88.5. Lowest ask remains high at $89.5. I placed a bid of $85.6 to improve queue position and signal willingness to trade without sacrificing profit.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of $85.6 again to maintain competitiveness; observed that asks remain stubbornly high above $91.5 with no trades triggered near our bid.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, I maintained my bid at $85.6, observing the bid queue still tightly clustered between $85.5 and $86.25 and asks persistently high around $94.9 and above. No trades occurred near my bid this hour.
Hour 7: Maintained bid at 85.6 with bid queue dense between 85.6 and 86.3, asks remain high around 94.9 to 96.79, no trades executed this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, I lowered my bid to 85.3 aiming to better match recent trade prices around mid-80s while observing asks remain firm above 94.9 and bids still dense between 85.3 and 86.3.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, bid queue remained dense between 85.3 and 86.4 with no significant ask price drops; no trades occurred near my previous bid of 85.3. I placed a bid of 85.5 to increase competitiveness slightly while preserving margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $83.70, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.64, aiming to position well in the queue while maintaining profitability margin. No trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.10, slightly above previous $83.70, to improve competitiveness. Market still shows wide spread with asks around $95-$97 and no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $85.30, slightly above the highest bids clustered at $85.25. Observed that the lowest ask remains at $89 from Seller Ilan, with other asks still high around $95-$96.
Hour 4: Observed bid queue dense around $85.3-$85.5 with some buyers pushing to $85.6 and one buyer at $88.5. Lowest ask remains high at $89.5. I placed a bid of $85.6 to improve queue position and signal willingness to trade without sacrificing profit.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of $85.6 again to maintain competitiveness; observed that asks remain stubbornly high above $91.5 with no trades triggered near our bid.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, I maintained my bid at $85.6, observing the bid queue still tightly clustered between $85.5 and $86.25 and asks persistently high around $94.9 and above. No trades occurred near my bid this hour.
Hour 7: Maintained bid at 85.6 with bid queue dense between 85.6 and 86.3, asks remain high around 94.9 to 96.79, no trades executed this hour.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, I lowered my bid to 85.3 aiming to better match recent trade prices around mid-80s while observing asks remain firm above 94.9 and bids still dense between 85.3 and 86.3.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, bid queue remained dense between 85.3 and 86.4 with no significant ask price drops; no trades occurred near my previous bid of 85.3. I placed a bid of 85.5 to increase competitiveness slightly while preserving margin.
Hour 10: Placed bid at 85.6; bid queue remains dense between 85.5 and 86.4; asks remain firm above 94.8 with no trades occurring near my bid this hour.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, bid queue remained dense with bids clustered between 85.6 and 86.5; asks persistently high near 94.87 to 96.08; no trades occurred near my bid. I placed a bid of 85.6 to maintain position.
Hour 12: Placed bid at 85.6; bid queue remains dense between 85.6 and 86.5; ask prices stubbornly high near 94.86 to 96.08; no trades executed near my bid this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains dense 85.6 to 86.5; asks firmly high 94.86 to 96.08; no trades near highest bids; market illiquid at ask level; no downward ask movement. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 85.6 preserves position and margin but fails to trigger trades; sellers anchored; market remains illiquid near bid level. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bid at 85.6 this hour to keep competitiveness and margin; watch carefully for any ask price drops; prepare to reduce bid if no trades by Hour 13 to secure trades before session end.


# Output Format

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue continues dense between $85.6 and $86.5; ask prices hold firm in the mid-90s with no downward movement; no trades near my bid; market remains illiquid at ask level. #### Thoughts: Holding $85.6 preserves position and margin but fails to trigger trades; sellers anchored at high ask prices; risk of no trades if bid remains too high relative to ask. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.6 this hour to keep competitive but prepare to reduce bid if no trades by Hour 14 to increase chances of securing trades before end of session.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a bid at $85.6 for several hours to balance competitiveness and profitability, no trades have been secured. The persistent high ask prices in the mid-90s created a large spread, limiting trade opportunities. Other buyers have bid higher up to $86.5, but no matching asks have appeared near these bids. This suggests sellers are reluctant to lower asks, and our bids may be too conservative to trigger trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To improve chances of executing a trade before the final hour, I will slightly increase my bid to $86.0 to better compete with the top buyers while still retaining a reasonable profit margin. This should position us closer to the highest bids and may attract willing sellers to cross the spread if they see active demand. If this fails, I will consider a more aggressive bid reduction in Hour 15 to ensure some trades.",

No trades occurred near my previous bid of $85.6. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.6 did not trigger trades; increasing bid closer to $86.0 might improve trade chances without sacrificing too much margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustering remains between $85.6 and $86.5, with no ask prices dropping toward bids. The spread remains very wide, limiting trade execution. No trades occurred near my previous bid of $85.6. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.6 did not trigger trades; increasing bid closer to $86.0 might improve trade chances without sacrificing too much margin. Sellers appear anchored at high ask prices, so buyer initiative is required. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.0 this hour to move closer to top buyers and encourage trade execution; prepare for potential bid reduction in final hour if no trades occur, prioritizing securing trades over margin at session end.
