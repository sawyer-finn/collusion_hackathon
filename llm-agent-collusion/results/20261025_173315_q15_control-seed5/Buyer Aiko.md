# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Aiko. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Aiko. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with no trades. The highest bid was 83.66 by Buyer Aiko, and the lowest ask was 96.45 by Seller Omar. I placed a new higher bid at 84.10 to improve trade prospects while maintaining margin.
Hour 2: Hour #2 opened with no trades; bid queue highest remains 84.10 by Buyer Aiko, asks remain high around 96.4+. I placed a new bid at 84.50 to improve chances of trade.
Hour 3: Hour #3 opened with no trades; highest bid now 85.0 by Buyer Amir and 85.25 by Buyer Aiko; asks remain clustered in the mid-96s. I placed a new bid at 85.25 to improve chances of trade.
Hour 4: Hour #4 opened with no trades; I placed a bid at 85.60, maintaining the top bid position and increasing buying pressure slightly.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm in mid-96 range; bids now cluster up to 88.0 but no trades happen; my bid at 86.5 is closer to top buyers but still well below asks. #### Thoughts: Previous incremental bid increases maintained top position but did not induce trades; sellers not reacting to bids below 87; large bid-ask spread persists. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.5 to signal stronger buying intent and attempt to narrow spread; monitor seller reactions; preserve margin by keeping bids well below 90 and true value 100; prepare for gradual increments if sellers remain firm, or consider withdrawing if market remains stagnant.

# Market Rules

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks around 96.3-96.7; bids cluster up to 88.05, my bid now 87.5; persistent large bid-ask spread; no trades executed so far.
#### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep me near the top of the bid queue but fail to close the gap; sellers show no sign of lowering prices; risk of no trade if I maintain margins too strictly.
#### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to 87.5 to test seller flexibility while preserving margin; watch seller reactions for any ask reductions or trade opportunities; if sellers remain rigid, consider further small bid increments or a strategic bid withdrawal to reassess market dynamics on next hour.

# Market Rules

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm on asks around 96.3-96.7; bid queue topped at 88.2 but no trades; my bid now increased to 88.0 to match top bids. Large bid-ask spread persists with no executed trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have maintained top bid but gap remains wide; sellers show no sign of lowering asks; risk of no trades if margins remain high. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 88.0 to probe seller flexibility and maintain competitiveness; monitor for seller response or trades; prepare to escalate carefully or withdraw bid next hour if no progress.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks ~96.28-96.41; bids topped at 89.25; no trades yet; spread remains large. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintained top bid but failed to induce seller flexibility or trades; cautious bid preserves margin but risks no trades. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 89.25 this hour to signal continued strong buying interest; avoid margin erosion; monitor seller responses closely; prepare to reconsider or withdraw bids in Hour 15 if no progress.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook.

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining the highest bid position and gradually increasing my bid over the hours, no trades have occurred due to the persistent large spread and firm seller asks around $96.27-$96.41. My cautious incremental approach preserved margin but failed to signal enough buying pressure to induce seller flexibility.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the last hour and no trades have been secured, I will maintain my bid at $89.25 to avoid unnecessary margin erosion while still signaling strong buying interest. A more aggressive bid risks loss with no guaranteed trades, and withdrawing the bid would concede the market. I will observe if sellers adjust or if a trade can be triggered.",
  "bid": 89.25,
  "new_memory": "Hour #15 opened with no trades; seller asks remain firm around $96.27-$96.41; I maintained my bid at $89.25 to keep highest bid status and consistent buying pressure.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: No trades in Hour #15; sellers remain firm at $96.27-$96.41; bid unchanged at $89.25. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid avoids margin loss and continues to signal demand, but spread remains large and no market movement occurred. #### Updated Strategy: Retain bid at $89.25 for final hour to maximize chance of trade without excessive margin sacrifice; prepare for post-auction analysis on possible strategy adjustments for future markets."
