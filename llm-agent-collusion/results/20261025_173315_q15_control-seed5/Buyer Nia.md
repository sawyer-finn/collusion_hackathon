# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Continue to monitor ask price movements closely. Prepare to adjust bid upwards more aggressively if ask prices fall or if approaching final hours to secure trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.61 to $83.66 and asks from $96.45 to $98.55. I placed a bid at $83.60, near the top of the bid queue but below the highest bid.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue showed slight upward movement with my bid at $83.60 and the highest bid at $84.10; asks remain high around $96.40-$98.55, indicating no trades yet. I placed a bid at $83.65 to improve my position.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows a slight increase in top bids with my bid at $83.75, placing me closer to the top bids but still below the highest bid of $85. The ask queue remains high, around $96.4 to $98.1, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $83.75.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bid queue remains clustered with top bids now at $85-$86 and asks stubbornly between $96.38 and $98.1. I raised my bid to $84.00, moving closer to the top bidders but still below the highest bid of $86. No trades occurred.

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows a slight increase in top bids with my bid at $83.75, placing me closer to the top bids but still below the highest bid of $85. The ask queue remains high, around $96.4 to $98.1, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $83.75.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids remain clustered $84-$88, my bid at $84.25 now closer to mid-top bids; ask prices remain high and stable $96.37-$98.1; no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers still unwilling to lower asks; marginal bid increase may improve queue position and signal readiness to buy; still wide bid-ask spread limits immediate trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Increment bids cautiously to improve position gradually; monitor seller ask behavior closely; prepare to escalate bids more aggressively if no trade activity by Hour 8-10; balance profitability and urgency as time horizon shortens.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids cluster between $84.25 and $88.05 with my bid at $85.00; asks remain high and stable around $96.34-$98.1; no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm on ask prices, showing no sign of lowering; maintaining bid at $85.00 keeps me competitive while preserving margin; incremental increases so far haven't triggered trades but avoid price overreach. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $85.00 to probe seller willingness to lower asks; closely watch for any ask price drops or trade activity next hour; prepare to escalate bid more aggressively after Hour 9 if no trades occur, accepting lower margins to secure deals before deadline.

# Market Rules

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids continue clustering between $85.5 and $89.0; seller asks remain rigid near $96.28-$96.41; no trades despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers have strong resistance to lowering ask prices, maintaining a wide spread; incremental bid increases have yet to entice trades. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $87.75 to convey strong buying interest while preserving margin; prepare for a sharp bid increase in the final hour to try to secure trade(s) if asks remain unchanged; continuously monitor ask price changes for market signals.

{
  "reflection": "Over the past hours, incremental bid increases have failed to provoke a trade due to the persistent large spread and rigid seller asks near $96.27-$96.41. Maintaining bids around $87.75 preserved margin but did not secure trades. Earlier attempts to climb bids gradually did not close the gap, indicating sellers are not yet pressured to lower asks.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I must prioritize securing trades even at reduced margins to avoid zero profit. I will raise my bid significantly closer to my true value of $100 but still below it, to improve chances of matching sellers' asks or prompting sellers to lower their asks. A bid around $90.50 balances improved competitiveness with some profit retention.",
  "bid": 90.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I increased my bid sharply to $90.50 to aggressively improve my position and try to induce trades before market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Top bids clustered $86.25-$90.5; seller asks remain firm at $96.27-$96.41; no trades despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong price resistance; incremental approach ineffective; wide spread persists. #### Updated Strategy: Final hour requires aggressive bid increase near $90.50 to push for trades; accept narrower margins rather than no trade; monitor for any seller ask movement and adjust accordingly if possible."
