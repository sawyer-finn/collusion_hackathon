# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Monitor ask prices for any narrowing. Prepare to incrementally raise bids further in subsequent hours aiming to secure trades before hour 15 with acceptable profit margins.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 market opened with bids clustered around $81 to $83.7 and asks from $96.35 upwards. I placed a bid at $83.50, positioning just above the highest bidders but well below asks, as no trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows my bid at $83.50 is below the top bids now reaching $85.00 by Buyer Mia; asks remain well above at $96.30+. I placed a new bid at $84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows bids clustered from $83.81 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.9, positioned below top buyers but still well below asks around $96.3. I raised my bid to $85.0 to edge closer to the top bids.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with top bids ranging from 85.0 to 86.0 led by Buyer Mia, while asks remain stubbornly high near 96.3 to 98.3. I placed my bid at 85.0, maintaining position just below the highest bids.

Hour 1: Hour #1 market opened with bids clustered around $81 to $83.7 and asks from $96.35 upwards. I placed a bid at $83.50, positioning just above the highest bidders but well below asks, as no trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows my bid at $83.50 is below the top bids now reaching $85.00 by Buyer Mia; asks remain well above at $96.30+. I placed a new bid at $84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows bids clustered from $83.81 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.9, positioned below top buyers but still well below asks around $96.3. I raised my bid to $85.0 to edge closer to the top bids.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with top bids ranging from 85.0 to 86.0 led by Buyer Mia, while asks remain stubbornly high near 96.3 to 98.3. I placed my bid at 85.0, maintaining position just below the highest bids.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered with top bids from 85.0 to 86.5 and asks steady above 96.26. I increased my bid to 85.20, moving slightly closer to the top without risking margin.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains clustered from 85.01 to 86.6 with my bid steady at 85.20, while asks hold firm above 96.25. No trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains dense around 85.0 to 86.6 with no trades; asks firmly above 96.25. Incremental bid increases have not provoked seller concessions. #### Thoughts: Sellers are maintaining a wide spread and are not reacting to moderate bid increases. Large bid jumps not justified given current lack of trades and margin constraints. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 85.20 to maintain a good queue position without eroding margin. Monitor seller behavior and be prepared to raise bids more aggressively if no trades occur by hour 10 or if sellers start lowering asks.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Bid queue remains dense from 85.2 to 86.7 with no trades; asks steady above 96.24.

No evidence sellers lower asks despite bid competition. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 85.20 to maintain position and margin. Monitor seller behavior closely. Be ready to increase bids more aggressively if no trades by hour 10 or if asks soften.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 market opened with bids clustered around $81 to $83.7 and asks from $96.35 upwards. I placed a bid at $83.50, positioning just above the highest bidders but well below asks, as no trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows my bid at $83.50 is below the top bids now reaching $85.00 by Buyer Mia; asks remain well above at $96.30+. I placed a new bid at $84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows bids clustered from $83.81 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.9, positioned below top buyers but still well below asks around $96.3. I raised my bid to $85.0 to edge closer to the top bids.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with top bids ranging from 85.0 to 86.0 led by Buyer Mia, while asks remain stubbornly high near 96.3 to 98.3. I placed my bid at 85.0, maintaining position just below the highest bids.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered with top bids from 85.0 to 86.5 and asks steady above 96.26. I increased my bid to 85.20, moving slightly closer to the top without risking margin.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains clustered from 85.01 to 86.6 with my bid steady at 85.20, while asks hold firm above 96.25. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remained dense with top bids between 85.2 and 86.7; asks held firm above 96.24. I maintained my bid at 85.20, preserving position without escalating price.
Hour 8: Hour 8 bid queue remains dense from 85.2 to 86.7 with no trades; ask prices steady above 96.24. I maintained my bid at 85.20.
Hour 9: Hour 9 bid queue remains dense with top bids from 85.2 to 86.75 and asks steady above 96.22. I maintained my bid at 85.20, holding position without escalating price.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue dense around 85.20 to 86.75; asks steady above 96.21 with no trades; top buyers bid near 86.7. Incremental bids below 85.5 failed to move market. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no sign of concession; top bids create high competition; my previous cautious bidding insufficient to induce trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.50 to close gap with top buyers and pressure sellers, maintaining reasonable margin. Monitor for seller ask reductions or trades. Prepare to escalate bids further if no trades by hour 12 or if asks remain firm.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 market opened with bids clustered around $81 to $83.7 and asks from $96.35 upwards. I placed a bid at $83.50, positioning just above the highest bidders but well below asks, as no trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows my bid at $83.50 is below the top bids now reaching $85.00 by Buyer Mia; asks remain well above at $96.30+. I placed a new bid at $84.90 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows bids clustered from $83.81 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.9, positioned below top buyers but still well below asks around $96.3. I raised my bid to $85.0 to edge closer to the top bids.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the bid queue shows a dense cluster with top bids ranging from 85.0 to 86.0 led by Buyer Mia, while asks remain stubbornly high near 96.3 to 98.3. I placed my bid at 85.0, maintaining position just below the highest bids.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remains clustered with top bids from 85.0 to 86.5 and asks steady above 96.26. I increased my bid to 85.20, moving slightly closer to the top without risking margin.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains clustered from 85.01 to 86.6 with my bid steady at 85.20, while asks hold firm above 96.25. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue remained dense with top bids between 85.2 and 86.7; asks held firm above 96.24. I maintained my bid at 85.20, preserving position without escalating price.
Hour 8: Hour 8 bid queue remains dense from 85.2 to 86.7 with no trades; ask prices steady above 96.24. I maintained my bid at 85.20.
Hour 9: Hour 9 bid queue remains dense with top bids from 85.2 to 86.75 and asks steady above 96.22. I maintained my bid at 85.20, holding position without escalating price.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, bids remain dense and clustered near 86.7 at the top with asks stable above 96.21. I increased my bid to 86.50 to better compete with top buyers while still below seller asks.
Hour 11: Hour 11 shows top bids clustered tightly between 86.5 and 86.9 with my bid steady at 86.50; asks remain stubbornly high near 96.2 to 98.3, no trades yet.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Dev. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids have increased to 87.15-87.3; sellers remain firm with asks above 96.19; no trades have occurred despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not reacting to incremental bid increases, maintaining high asks. Holding margin is important but risk losing chance to trade if bid is too low. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 87.15 to signal stronger buying intent and compete with top buyers; still below ask to preserve margin. Prepare to bid even higher in Hour 15 if no trade occurs to maximize trade chances before market closes.

{
  "reflection": "Despite incremental bid increases over the past hours, no trades have occurred, indicating sellers are firmly anchored at high ask prices around 96.19 and above. Holding back on bids to preserve margin has not yielded any trades so far, and the gap between bids and asks remains wide. My previous strategy to stay just below top bids maintained position but did not pressure sellers enough.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will increase my bid significantly to $90.00 to improve chances of trading before market closes, balancing the need to secure a trade against the true value of $100. This is a calculated risk to break the deadlock between buyers and sellers and capitalize on any potential willingness from sellers to lower asks or match bids.",
  "bid": 90.0,
  "new_memory": "Hour #15 shows bids slightly higher with my bid at 90.00, significantly above prior bids but still below the lowest asks near 95.99. Sellers have maintained stubborn asks around 96.19 to 98.3. No trades occurred.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks above 95.99; bids have clustered around 87-87.5 but no trades yet; my previous bid at 87.15 was insufficient to induce trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not budging on ask prices despite bid increases; the price gap remains large; with limited time left, a more aggressive bid is necessary to secure a trade. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $90.00 this hour to signal stronger buying intent and maximize chance of trade before market closes, while still preserving profit margin relative to $100 true value."
