# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from 81.39 to 83.73 and asks from 96.35 to 98.48. I placed a bid at 83.80, slightly higher than the current highest bid of 83.73.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows the bid queue topped by Buyer Mia at 85.0, with several buyers clustered around 83.7-84.0 and multiple 83.8 bids including mine. Asks remain high, starting at 96.3. I placed a bid of 85.10.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain clustered below 85.5 with my bid at 85.25, slightly above highest current bid. Asks still high starting at 96.28, no trades yet.
Hour 4: Hour 4 shows bids clustering between 84.0 and 86.0, with my bid placed at 86.10, slightly above the highest current bid of 86.0. Asks remain high starting at 96.27, and no trades have occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids continue steady incremental rises but remain well below stable asks above 96.25. Sellers show no signs of lowering their asks, maintaining a wide spread. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bids just above the highest bid keeps competitive pressure but no trades yet, indicating seller confidence or low urgency. Large spread reduces incentive to jump bids drastically. #### Updated Strategy: Keep incremental bid increases modest, targeting just above the highest bid (86.6) to test seller resolve while preserving profit margin. Watch for any shift in asks or trade activity to adjust aggressiveness. Prepare to accelerate bid increases in later hours if no trades occur to avoid missing trading opportunities before hour 15.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids continue slow incremental rises just above highest bids; asks remain unchanged above 96.23, preserving wide spread; no trades occurred this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no urgency to lower asks; incremental bid increases keep us competitive but haven't triggered trades. Large spread discourages aggressive bid jumps. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain marginal bid increase above highest bid (now 86.71 to 86.72) to test seller resolve without sacrificing margin; monitor for any ask reduction or trade activity; prepare to accelerate bid increases in future hours if no trades by mid-game to avoid missing opportunities before hour 15.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids now at 86.85 and 86.76; asks remain stable above 96.21 with no downward movement; no trades occurred in Hour 10. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm with asks well above bids, indicating reluctance to lower prices; incremental bid increases keep us competitive but do not close the large spread; maintaining bid leadership is critical to secure trades later. #### Updated Strategy: Slightly increase bid to 86.86 to maintain top position and test market reaction; monitor for any ask price adjustment; prepare to more aggressively increase bids after Hour 12 if no trades occur to secure profitable deals before the market closes.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly grouped just below 87, with sellers holding asks firmly above 96.19, maintaining a wide spread and no trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases signal strong but cautious buying interest, but sellers are not pressured to reduce asks, widening the spread persists. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases this hour to maintain top bid position and buyer presence; prepare to increase bid more substantially after Hour 12 if sellers remain steadfast, aiming to secure trades before Hour 15 while balancing profitability and urgency.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly grouped below $87.5; asks hold firmly above $96.18 with no trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases insufficient to bridge wide bid-ask spread; sellers maintain strong resistance. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid more aggressively to $87.50 this hour to signal serious buying intent and potentially induce a trade; maintain balance between profit margin and urgency ahead of final hour.


# Output Format

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #15. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

{
  "reflection": "Despite consistently increasing my bid incrementally, no trades have occurred due to the wide bid-ask spread and sellers' firm asking prices well above $96. This shows that small bid increments have been ineffective in closing the gap or inducing seller concessions. A more strategic balance between bid aggressiveness and profit preservation is now critical given the final hour.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I will maintain my bid at $87.50 to assert strong buying interest while preserving profit margin. Increasing the bid further risks reducing profitability without guarantee of trade due to sellers' firm asks. Maintaining $87.50 signals consistent demand and may pressure sellers slightly, but I will not overbid beyond this point.",
  "bid": 87.5,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 opened with bids clustered at or below $87.50, including my bid maintaining the highest at $87.50. Asks remain firm and high, starting at $95.99 with no trades occurring in this final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids remain tightly grouped at or below $87.50; asks still hold firm above $95.99 with no trades; sellers are not budging despite consistent high bids. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases failed to induce trades; sellers maintain a strong resistance price well above buyer bids; profit margin preservation is key as true value is $100. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $87.50 in the final hour to assert strong buying interest without sacrificing profitability; avoid further bid escalation as it may not yield trades given seller ask rigidity; focus on maximizing profit from potential late trades or prepare to reassess strategy in future auctions."
