# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Updated Strategy: Slightly increase bid to 85.30 to keep priority and gently push sellers. Avoid large jumps to preserve profit margin. Closely monitor ask price movements to adjust bid aggressiveness and timing for future hours.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from 81.39 to 83.73 and asks from 96.35 to 98.48. I placed a bid of 83.75, slightly above the highest competing bid, aiming to improve trade chances while maintaining profit margin.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, bids ranged from 83.5 to 85.0 with my bid at 85.05 slightly above the highest competitor bid. Asks remain high, ranging from 96.3 to 98.48 with no trades occurring.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of 85.30, slightly above the highest competing bid of 85.25. The ask queue remains high with no trades occurring, confirming seller resistance at prices above 96.3.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows aggressive bidding clustered around 85.3 to 86.0 with my bid at 85.35 maintaining a slight lead. The ask queue remains unchanged with sellers firm at 96.3 and above. No trades occurred this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue still clustered 85.01-86.6 with my bid leading at 85.35; ask queue stable above 96.25; no trades yet; spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain resistant to incremental bid increases; buyers compete closely but no crossing of spread; maintaining top bid helps keep pressure without sacrificing margin; no indication sellers will lower asks soon. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 85.35 to maintain priority and monitor market reaction closely; prepare to increase bid more aggressively if no trades occur in next few hours or if bid cluster tightens; balance pressure on sellers with margin preservation given limited time horizon before Hour #15.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue led by aggressive buyers with bids up to 86.71, my bid withdrawn this hour; ask queue unchanged with sellers firm above 96.23; no trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain highly resistant to price reductions; withdrawing my bid tests market reaction and reduces risk exposure; aggressive buyers dominate bidding now. #### Updated Strategy: Temporarily withdraw bid to observe seller behavior; prepare to re-enter with a strategically higher bid closer to 86.5–87 if sellers remain firm, balancing margin and urgency as the auction nears Hour #15; monitor aggressive buyer bids for potential price signaling.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm above 96.2; buyers cluster bids near 86.7; spread remains large and no trades executed yet. #### Thoughts: Market inactivity suggests sellers unwilling to reduce asks; buyers reluctant to push bids beyond ~86.7; maintaining a stable bid at 86.5 balances market presence and margin preservation. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 86.50 to stay competitive but avoid aggressive bidding wars; monitor for seller ask decreases or buyer bid escalations; prepare to increment bids gradually if no seller concessions occur as deadline approaches; maintain flexibility to withdraw or adjust bid based on market shifts.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain stubbornly above 96.19; buyer bids cluster tightly around 86.75 to 87.0; no trades executed yet; bid-ask spread remains large, limiting trade probability. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 86.90 preserves competitive position without sacrificing margin unnecessarily. Sellers remain firm; patience needed. Incremental bid increases may be necessary only if seller asks drop meaningfully. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 86.90 this hour to reinforce top position; closely monitor ask queue for signs of softening; prepare to raise bid in small increments if ask prices fall closer to bid range as deadline nears; consider withdrawing bid if spread remains too wide and no trading momentum builds.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered around 86.75 to 87.15; sellers firm above 96.12 with no trades. Large bid-ask spread persists, limiting trade execution. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at 87.15 sustains a top position without sacrificing margin prematurely. Sellers show no indication of lowering asks; patience remains key. Incremental bid increases should be reserved for the final hour if asks soften. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 87.15 this hour to keep market presence; monitor ask prices for any drops near or below 96; prepare to raise bid incrementally in Hour #15 if sellers reduce asks to improve trade chances; avoid withdrawing bid to sustain competitiveness and visibility.

````json
{
  "reflection": "Despite consistently maintaining top bids around 87.15 and closely matching or slightly trailing the highest buyers, no trades have occurred due to seller asks remaining rigid above 95.99 to 98.3. Patience was warranted given the large bid-ask spread, but this has resulted in zero trades and no profit. The lack of seller concession indicates a strong resistance at or above 96, limiting trading opportunities without aggressive bid escalation.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "As this is the final hour, to maximize the likelihood of at least one trade before the market closes, I will increment my bid moderately above the highest current bid of 87.5, aiming to signal seriousness and possibly trigger a seller to lower their ask or accept the bid. I will place a bid at 87.55 to remain below my true value of 100 while improving chances of execution, balancing profit and trade completion.",
  "bid": 87.55,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids at 87.5; seller asks continue firm above 95.99. I placed a bid of 87.55, slightly above the highest competing bids, to enhance trade prospects in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue top bids at 87.5; sellers remain firm above 95.99; no trades thus far after 15 hours. #### Thoughts: The persistent large spread and seller rigidity prevented earlier trades; final hour requires a stronger bid signal to prompt seller action. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above 87.5 to 87.55 to maximize trade chance while preserving profit margin; prepare to accept no trade if sellers maintain asks; this is the last opportunity to secure a deal."
