# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

- Shifting bids slightly upward might improve queue position without sacrificing margin.

#### Updated Strategy
- Incrementally increase bid above highest current bid to gain priority.
- Monitor ask prices for signs of decrease.
- Avoid aggressive bids near $100 in early hours to maximize profit.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.80 in Hour #1, which is slightly above the highest current bid of $83.73. The bid queue remains below my true value of $100, and the ask queue is still high, with no trades made yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue peaked at $85.00, and asks remain high between $96.3 and $98.48. I placed a bid at $85.10 to outbid the current highest bidder, aiming for better trade priority.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the highest bid increased to $85.25 by Buyer Jun, and the ask queue remains high between $96.28 and $98.3. I placed my bid at $85.30 to maintain priority and pressure sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at $85.36, slightly above the highest bid ($85.35). The ask queue remains high, still between $96.3 and $98.3, with no trades executed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations - Highest bid now $85.56; seller asks still high at $96.25-$98.3; no trades so far. #### Thoughts - Sellers remain firm; small bid increments keep us competitive but no market movement yet; risk of missing trades if sellers do not lower asks. #### Updated Strategy - Increase bid slightly to $85.56 to maintain top position and test seller firmness; watch for ask queue changes; prepare to escalate bids more aggressively in coming hours if no trades materialize to secure deals within limited time horizon.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue peaked at $85.00, and asks remain high between $96.3 and $98.48. I placed a bid at $85.10 to outbid the current highest bidder, aiming for better trade priority.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the highest bid increased to $85.25 by Buyer Jun, and the ask queue remains high between $96.28 and $98.3. I placed my bid at $85.30 to maintain priority and pressure sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at $85.36, slightly above the highest bid ($85.35). The ask queue remains high, still between $96.3 and $98.3, with no trades executed.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations - Highest bid now $85.61 before this hour, sellers still firm with asks $96.23-$98.3; no trades yet. Buyer bids cluster below $87, sellers firmly above $96. #### Thoughts - Incremental bid increases maintain priority but do not move market or induce trades. Sellers remain unwilling to lower prices; risk of no trades increases with time. Need to balance bid increases to avoid eroding profit margin prematurely. #### Updated Strategy - Raise bid slightly to $85.65 to keep top spot and pressure sellers, signaling seriousness without large margin sacrifice. Monitor ask queue closely for any downward moves or trade activity. If no progress by hour 10, consider more substantial bid increments to secure trades before deadline while managing profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.80 in Hour #1, which is slightly above the highest current bid of $83.73. The bid queue remains below my true value of $100, and the ask queue is still high, with no trades made yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue peaked at $85.00, and asks remain high between $96.3 and $98.48. I placed a bid at $85.10 to outbid the current highest bidder, aiming for better trade priority.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the highest bid increased to $85.25 by Buyer Jun, and the ask queue remains high between $96.28 and $98.3. I placed my bid at $85.30 to maintain priority and pressure sellers.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at $85.36, slightly above the highest bid ($85.35). The ask queue remains high, still between $96.3 and $98.3, with no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at $85.51, slightly increasing our lead atop the bid queue. Seller asks remain high and unchanged, still between $96.26 and $98.3, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $85.56, slightly above the highest bid of $85.55. Seller asks remain stubbornly high between $96.25 and $98.3, and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the highest bid moved slightly higher to 85.6, sellers remain firm with asks between 96.24 and 98.3, and no trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.61 to maintain the top position.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $85.65, maintaining the top bid position. The ask queue remained stubbornly high between $96.23 and $98.3 with no trades occurring.
Hour 9: Placed a bid at $86.76, just above the highest bid of $86.75. Seller asks remain stubborn between $96.22 and $98.3, and no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations - Highest bid now $86.85 before this hour, sellers still firm with asks $96.21-$98.3; no trades yet. Buyer bids cluster below $87, sellers firmly above $96. #### Thoughts - Incremental bid increases maintain priority with minimal margin loss but have not moved sellers or induced trades. Sellers remain unwilling to lower prices; risk of no trades increases with time approaching hour 15. #### Updated Strategy - Raise bid slightly above current highest bid ($86.86) to keep top spot and apply gentle pressure. Monitor ask queue for any downward movement or trade activity. If no progress by hour 11, consider more substantial bid increments to secure trades before deadline while cautiously managing profitability.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at $85.51, slightly increasing our lead atop the bid queue. Seller asks remain high and unchanged, still between $96.26 and $98.3, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a bid at $85.56, slightly above the highest bid of $85.55. Seller asks remain stubbornly high between $96.25 and $98.3, and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, the highest bid moved slightly higher to 85.6, sellers remain firm with asks between 96.24 and 98.3, and no trades occurred. I placed a bid at 85.61 to maintain the top position.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $85.65, maintaining the top bid position. The ask queue remained stubbornly high between $96.23 and $98.3 with no trades occurring.
Hour 9: Placed a bid at $86.76, just above the highest bid of $86.75. Seller asks remain stubborn between $96.22 and $98.3, and no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations - Highest bid increased to $87.0; seller asks remain firm between $96.19 and $98.3. No trades despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts - Sellers maintain strong resistance, keeping ask prices high. The bid-ask spread remains wide, and buyers remain clustered below $87. The risk of no trades is growing as only 3 hours remain. #### Updated Strategy - Continue incremental bid increases to maintain priority and pressure sellers. Place bid at $87.05 this hour. Prepare to shift to more aggressive bidding near $90 if no trades by Hour #13 or #14, balancing the need to secure trades with protecting profitability.

# Market Rules

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations - Highest bids around $87.15 to $87.3; asks static at $96.12 to $98.3; no trades despite incremental bid increases; wide bid-ask spread persists. #### Thoughts - Sellers are firm at their ask prices; buyers clustered below $87.3; risk of no trades high with only 1 hour left after this; incremental increases haven't moved market. #### Updated Strategy - Increase bid moderately to $87.30 to maintain top position and push closer to ask range; prepare for a more aggressive bid near $90 in final hour if no trade occurs; balance urgency to trade with preserving profit margin.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases have maintained top position but failed to close the large gap between bids (~87.3) and asks (~96.1+), resulting in zero trades across all hours. The static, high ask prices suggest sellers are unlikely to reduce their prices, while buyers remain clustered below 87.5, indicating a market impasse. Waiting too long has risked no trades, highlighting the need for a more aggressive strategy as the deadline approaches.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I must increase the bid significantly to improve the chance of a trade while balancing profitability. A bid near 90.00 will signal seriousness and may prompt sellers to accept or other buyers to react. Maintaining the bid too low risks no trade and zero profit. I will bid $90.00 to push closer to the ask, accepting a lower margin but increasing trade probability before the market closes.",
  "bid": 90.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I placed a bid at $90.00, significantly increasing our bid from prior hours to improve the likelihood of a trade before market close. The bid queue shows some buyers clustered below 87.5, and seller asks remain high around 96.1 to 98.3.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations - Highest bids clustered below 87.5; asks firmly high around 96.1+; no trades despite incremental bid increases; wide bid-ask spread persists; final hour necessitates urgency. #### Thoughts - Sellers unlikely to reduce asks; buyers reluctant to cross 87.5; risk of zero trades very high without aggressive bid; profitability must be balanced with trade likelihood in final hour. #### Updated Strategy - Increase bid sharply to $90.00 to signal urgency and improve trade chances; accept reduced margin for securing trade; monitor if sellers lower asks or if any trades occur; prepare to finalize position at this price as last chance for profit."
