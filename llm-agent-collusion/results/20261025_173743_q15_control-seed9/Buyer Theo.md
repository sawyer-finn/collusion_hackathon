# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Theo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Theo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $83.10 in Hour #1 amid bids mostly around $82-$83 and asks in the $96-$98 range, with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $83.50 in Hour #2 amidst bids clustered around $83.0 to $85.0 and asks still high in the $96+ range; no trades yet.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remained clustered with bids between $83.11 and $86.5, and the ask queue stayed steady around $96.19 to $97.11. I placed a bid of $84.00 to test seller price flexibility.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $85.00 amid bids clustered between $83.5 and $88.0 and ask prices stable around $96.18 to $97.11, with no trades yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids clustered mid-80s to low 90s; no trades; asks steady near $96.16-$97.11; sellers resistant to lowering asks despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear firm; incremental bid increases have not induced trades or lower asks; risk of losing profit margin if bids increase too fast; time horizon limited but still early in market session. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $86.00 to maintain buying pressure without conceding margin; watch for any shifts in ask prices or trades; prepare to incrementally increase bids closer to true value after Hour #10 to balance securing trades against profit maximization.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids steady in mid-80s to low 90s; asks remain firm around $96.14-$97.11; no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering ask prices; incremental bid increases have not induced trades or price drops. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $86.00 to maintain moderate buying pressure and preserve profit margin. Monitor for any softening in asks or trade activity. Plan to reassess bid strategy after Hour 10, potentially increasing bids closer to true value to balance securing trades and maintaining profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Theo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Market rigidity on ask side suggests sellers expect prices near $96+. Incremental increases may be necessary after Hour #11 to improve trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.00 for now, monitor bid and ask dynamics closely.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster stable mid-80s to low 90s; asks remain firm at $96.13-$97.11; no trades yet. Sellers continue to resist lowering ask prices. Buyers show moderate bidding activity but no crossing with asks. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $86.00 keeps buying presence without eroding margin but fails to induce trades. Market rigidity on ask side suggests sellers expect prices near $96+. Incremental increases may be necessary after Hour #11 to improve trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.00 for now, monitor bid and ask dynamics closely. Prepare incremental bid increases post-Hour #11 if no trades occur to balance profit and trade execution risk.

## Past Trades

Hour 12: Buyer Wei bought from Seller Tara at $96.55

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster stable mid-80s to low 90s; sellers maintain firm asks above $96.10; no trades yet despite incremental bid increases by others. #### Thoughts: Sellers exhibit strong price resistance; a wide bid-ask spread persists; my previous bid at $86.00 insufficient to induce trades but protects margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $88.00 to exert more buying pressure and test seller willingness to lower asks, without overly compromising profit margin. If no trade or ask movement by Hour #13, consider further incremental bid increases while monitoring market dynamics closely.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains in high 80s to low 90s; ask prices stubbornly firm above $96.09; no trades despite increasing bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain strong resistance, bid-ask spread remains wide; prior bids under $89.50 ineffective in inducing trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $91.00 this hour to escalate buying pressure and test seller flexibility before final hour. If no trade by Hour #15, consider mid-90s bid to secure trade balancing profit and likelihood.

{
  "reflection": "Despite progressively increasing bids from $83.10 up to $91.00, no trades have occurred, highlighting strong seller resistance at around $96.09 to $96.27. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers have not shown flexibility even as other buyers are bidding up to $96.01. Maintaining bids below $91.00 has been ineffective in securing any trades, and the market indicates a reluctance from sellers to drop below their current ask levels.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To secure at least one trade before the market closes, I will place a competitive bid closer to the sellers' ask cluster, but still below my true value of $100.00 to preserve some margin. A bid around $95.50 should increase the likelihood of a match, as it is above most other buyers' bids but still below the ask prices. This bid balances urgency to trade with profitability, given the final hour and no previous success.",
  "bid": 95.5,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid of $95.50 in Hour #15 amid a bid cluster from $88.25 to $96.01 and firm asks between $96.08 and $96.80, seeking to induce a trade before market close.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Persistent wide bid-ask spread with asks around $96.08-$96.27 and bids rising into the mid-90s; no trades for Buyer Theo despite increments to $91.00.\n#### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm, but other buyers are bidding near $96, hinting at possible trade at or just below $96. Seller unwillingness to drop below $96 suggests limited room for price concessions.\n#### Updated Strategy: Final hour requires aggressive bid close to ask prices; propose $95.50 to maximize chance of trade while preserving profit margin below $100 true value. If unsuccessful, accept no trade but maximize potential profit in future auctions."
