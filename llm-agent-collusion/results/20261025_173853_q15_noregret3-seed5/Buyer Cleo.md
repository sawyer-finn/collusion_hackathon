# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Cleo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Wide bid-ask spread ($81.61-$83.66 bids; $96.45-$98.55 asks)
- No trades yet; market just opened
- My bid at $82.75 was competitive but not highest

- No immediate trade opportunity due to large spread
- Need to increase bid slightly to gain priority among buyers
- True value $100 allows room to bid higher if needed

- Incrementally increase bids to top buyer bid without approaching asks too closely
- Monitor ask prices for any downward movement
- Balance between securing trades and maximizing profit margin
- Aim to stay patient early and be more aggressive closer to Hour #15

#### Observations: Bid queue now clustered just below $85.0; lowest asks at $84.99; no trades involving my bid yet. #### Thoughts: Increasing bid to $84.90 improves competitiveness and signals readiness to trade near current lowest asks; sellers may drop asks if buyers show willingness near $85. #### Updated Strategy: Continue raising bids incrementally, approaching lowest asks carefully to trigger trades; maintain margin buffer just under lowest ask; monitor ask drops closely; be prepared to bid up to $85.00 if necessary to secure trades before Hour #15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Cleo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: This is Hour #1. The market opened with bids ranging from $81.61 to $83.66 and asks from $96.45 to $98.55. I placed a bid at $83.00, positioning myself as the top buyer bid but still below the lowest ask price.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue shows buyer bids ranging mostly between $82.05 and $84.0 with my bid at $83.50, improving my position among top buyers. Asks remain mostly high, with one notable ask at $85.00 by Seller Ilan. No trades occurred yet with my bids.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows my bid at $84.90, positioning me near the top buyers but still below the lowest asks around $84.99; no trades occurred yet.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bid queue bids cluster just below $85, lowest ask is $84.9; I place a bid at $85.0 to position as a top buyer ready to trade at the lowest ask line.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue now clustered just below $85.0; lowest asks at $84.9; my previous bid $84.9 secured a trade last hour. #### Thoughts: Incrementally increasing bid to $85.0 matches lowest ask, increasing likelihood of trade without sacrificing margin; sellers may lower asks if buyers show readiness at this level. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to raise bids carefully toward $85.0 to secure trades; monitor ask drops; maintain margin buffer below true value of $100; be ready to adjust bids dynamically in coming hours to balance profitability and trade volume.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids cluster just below $85.0; lowest asks remain around $84.95 to $96.4; no significant drop in asks to match bids yet; my bid at $85.0 remains the top buyer bid. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear reluctant to lower ask prices below $85.0, indicating a potential resistance level; buyers cluster near $85.0 signaling a market consensus around this price; maintaining $85.0 bid balances trade probability and margin. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.0 for Hour #6 to pressure sellers while maintaining profitability; monitor ask price shifts closely; prepare to incrementally raise bid in subsequent hours if no trade occurs to avoid losing market position as time runs out.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids cluster just below $85.0; lowest asks steady around $84.91 - $84.94; sellers resist dropping asks below $85.0; my $85.00 bid remains top buyer bid. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain a price floor near $85.0, limiting trade volume; buyers cluster near this point indicating market consensus; maintaining $85.00 balances trade chances and profit. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.00 this hour to keep top position and pressure sellers; prepare to incrementally raise bid next hours if no trade occurs to avoid losing ground while maintaining margin; watch for any drop in asks to capitalize on lower prices.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Cleo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids cluster just below $85.00; lowest asks steady at $84.92-$84.93; sellers maintain resistance at this level. #### Thoughts: Sellers uphold a price floor near $85.00, limiting trade volume; buyers cluster near this price point showing market consensus; maintaining my $85.00 bid balances trade chances and profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.00 to keep top buyer spot and pressure sellers; prepare to incrementally raise bid if no trade occurs in subsequent hours to avoid losing ground while protecting margins; watch for any drop in asks to capitalize on lower prices.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids remain clustered just below $85.00; sellers hold asks tightly around $84.92-$84.93, maintaining a narrow spread and price resistance. #### Thoughts: Sellers are unwilling to lower asks below $84.9, limiting immediate trade opportunities; buyers cluster near $85.0 showing market consensus on value; maintaining $85.00 bid secures top position and trade chance without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.00 to sustain top buyer spot and pressure sellers; prepare to incrementally raise bid in coming hours if no trades occur to avoid losing ground; monitor ask movements closely to capitalize on any price drops; balance aggressiveness with profitability as time horizon shortens.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Cleo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids remain clustered just below $85.00; sellers hold asks tightly around $84.92-$84.94, maintaining a narrow spread and price resistance. #### Thoughts: Sellers are unwilling to lower asks below $84.9, limiting immediate trade opportunities; buyers cluster near $85.0 showing market consensus on value; maintaining $85.00 bid secures top position and trade chance without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.00 to sustain top buyer spot and pressure sellers; prepare to incrementally raise bid in coming hours if no trades occur to avoid losing ground; monitor ask movements closely to capitalize on any price drops; balance aggressiveness with profitability as time horizon shortens.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids remain clustered just below $85.00, with my bid at $85.00 holding top position. Ask queue lowest asks persist stubbornly around $84.92-$84.93, maintaining a narrow spread and strong seller resistance. #### Thoughts: Sellers hold firm near $84.92-$84.94 with no indication of lowering asks; buyers show consensus near $85.00. Incremental bid increases risk reducing profit margin prematurely. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $85.00 bid to secure top buyer position and continue trading near current prices. Monitor ask price movement closely. Prepare to incrementally raise bid in Hour #14 only if no better trade opportunities arise, balancing trade execution and profitability as time horizon shortens.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue bids remain clustered just below $85.00 with my bid at $85.00 holding top position; seller asks have risen to $88.5 and above, widening the spread. #### Thoughts: Seller ask prices increasing reduces likelihood of trades below $85, but my top bid still secures buying priority if sellers lower asks. No need to increase bid prematurely as sellers hold firm above $88.5, preserving profit margins. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $85.00 bid to keep top position and monitor if sellers lower asks nearer to $85. Prepare to increase bid in Hour #15 only if no trades occur and time runs out, balancing last opportunity for securing trades with profitability.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a steady bid at $85.00 has consistently secured the top buyer position and enabled numerous trades just below $85.00, balancing profitability and trade execution effectively. However, sellers' ask prices have recently increased significantly, widening the bid-ask spread and reducing trade opportunities. This suggests that holding firm at $85.00 preserved profit margins but limited final hour trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and seller asks have widened well above $85.00, I will maintain my bid at $85.00 to capture any last-minute seller concessions without sacrificing profit margin. Increasing the bid closer to my true value ($100) risks reducing profitability unnecessarily given sellers' current firm ask prices. Maintaining discipline and top bid positioning is optimal to maximize profit at this stage.",
  "bid": 85.0,
  "new_memory": "Hour #15 bid placed at $85.00; bid queue shows top bids slightly below $85.00 with no bids above mine; ask queue shows sellers holding asks high above $88.5, maintaining strong seller resistance.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue bids remain clustered just below $85.00 with my bid at $85.00 holding top buyer position; seller asks remain high above $88.5, indicating strong resistance and wide spread; no new bids above mine; no signs sellers lowering ask prices. #### Thoughts: Increasing bid above $85.00 risks reducing profit margins unnecessarily; sellers appear unwilling to lower asks to match bids; maintaining top bid preserves buying priority if sellers relent; time horizon now ended, so preserving profit margin is paramount. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.00 to keep top position and maximize profit margin in final hour; avoid increasing bid further given sellers' firm asks; accept potential fewer trades but with higher profitability."
