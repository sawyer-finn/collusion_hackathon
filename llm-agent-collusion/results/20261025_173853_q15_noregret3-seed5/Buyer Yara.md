# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids mostly in low 80s and asks in high 90s. I placed a bid at $84.00, above the current highest bid of $83.66, to position competitively in the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a highest bid of $84.0 by Buyer Nia, with asks still significantly higher starting at $85.0. I placed a bid at $84.25 to improve our position just above the current highest bid.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the highest bid is $84.25 and the lowest asks remain above $84.99. I placed a bid at $84.30, just above the current highest bid, to improve our position while maintaining profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the highest bid is $84.5 by Buyer Kit and the lowest ask is $84.9 by Seller Leo. I placed a bid at $84.55, just above the current highest bid to improve our competitive position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 1: You bought from Seller Kofi at $82.5





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid is $84.5, lowest ask at $84.9—spread narrowed but still significant relative to value of $100. Past increments of $0.05 are not shifting ask prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental $0.05 raises maintain competitiveness but may be too cautious. Larger increments could pressure sellers to lower asks or trigger trades. Avoid bids near ask prices to retain margin. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid by $0.25 above highest bid to $84.55 this hour. Monitor if this triggers ask price drops or trades. Stay below $85 to protect profit margins. Be ready to escalate bid more aggressively in future hours if asks remain high and trades do not occur.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 1: You bought from Seller Kofi at $82.5
Hour 5: You bought from Seller Mia at $84.88
Hour 6: You bought from Seller Ana at $84.86





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid increased to $84.89; lowest ask is now $84.95, the narrowest spread seen so far. Prior increments of $0.05 to $0.25 have gradually pushed bids higher with some successful trades at about $84.88-$84.89. Sellers have not yet dropped asks below $84.95. #### Thoughts: The spread is tightening, suggesting seller resistance at $84.95. A small incremental bid increase to $84.90 may prompt trades or pressure sellers to reconsider their asks, preserving margin while maintaining market presence. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $84.90 to maintain top bid and encourage trades. If asks remain stubborn, consider gradual bid increases in the next hours, balancing profit margin and trade likelihood as time horizon shortens.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, incremental bid increases successfully maintained our position near the highest bid and allowed trades at profitable prices near $84.85-$84.90.

Small bid increments may be necessary to break seller resistance without sacrificing margin. Immediate large jumps risk reducing profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Bid slightly above highest bid with incremental $0.01 to $0.05 increases (currently $84.91) to test seller flexibility. Monitor ask changes and trades closely to decide if larger increments or bid withdrawal are needed in coming hours as time horizon shortens."

Immediate large jumps risk reducing profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Bid slightly above highest bid with incremental $0.01 to $0.05 increases (currently $84.91) to test seller flexibility. Monitor ask changes and trades closely to decide if larger increments or bid withdrawal are needed in coming hours as time horizon shortens.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids mostly in low 80s and asks in high 90s. I placed a bid at $84.00, above the current highest bid of $83.66, to position competitively in the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a highest bid of $84.0 by Buyer Nia, with asks still significantly higher starting at $85.0. I placed a bid at $84.25 to improve our position just above the current highest bid.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the highest bid is $84.25 and the lowest asks remain above $84.99. I placed a bid at $84.30, just above the current highest bid, to improve our position while maintaining profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the highest bid is $84.5 by Buyer Kit and the lowest ask is $84.9 by Seller Leo. I placed a bid at $84.55, just above the current highest bid to improve our competitive position.
Hour 5: Hour 5 saw the bid queue with a highest bid at $84.8 and lowest ask at $86.0. I placed a bid at $84.95, $0.25 above the previous highest bid to strengthen our competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the highest bid was $84.89 and the lowest ask was $84.95. I placed a bid at $84.90, slightly above the current highest bid to improve our competitive position while balancing profitability.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the highest bid was $84.9 multiple times and the lowest asks remained at $84.91 and above. I placed my bid at $84.91 to marginally improve our position while maintaining profitability.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I observed the highest bids remain clustered at $84.9 and the lowest asks are still at $84.91. I placed a bid at $84.92 to slightly outbid others and attempt to secure trades.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids are clustered at $84.9 with lowest asks at $84.91, showing a very narrow and stable spread. Sellers are firm at $84.91, and small bid increments have not yet triggered sellers to lower asks. Past increments of $0.01-$0.05 have been necessary to maintain competitiveness without sacrificing margin. #### Thoughts: The market is near equilibrium with limited movement on asks. Small incremental bids just above $84.9 may help secure trades without eroding profitability. Larger jumps risk reducing margins and withdrawing bids may lose position. #### Updated Strategy: Place bids slightly above highest bid cluster by $0.01-$0.02 increments to test seller willingness to trade at current ask levels. Monitor new trades and ask adjustments closely. Prepare to adjust strategy by either increasing bid increments or withdrawing bids if no trades materialize by mid-game hours.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bids remain clustered at $84.9-$84.91 with lowest asks steady at $84.92-$84.93, showing a persistent narrow spread. Sellers are firm, resisting lower asks despite repeated bid improvements. #### Thoughts: Consistent $0.01 bid increments maintain our competitive position without compromising profit. Sellers may wait for bids to match their asks before trading. Large bid jumps risk lowering margins. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to increment bids by $0.01 above highest bid to test seller response and secure trades near ask prices. Avoid bid withdrawal to retain market presence. Monitor for any shifts in seller ask prices or trade activity to adjust bid increments accordingly.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices remain clustered tightly around $84.9-$84.92. Lowest ask has stayed consistently at $84.93, with sellers showing strong resistance to lowering asks. Trades continue to execute near $84.9-$84.93 range. #### Thoughts: Incremental $0.01 improvements effectively secure trades close to the lowest ask while preserving margin. Sellers' firm ask prices limit potential for more aggressive bidding without margin sacrifice. Maintaining bid presence is crucial to stay competitive. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $0.01 above highest bid to remain top in queue and secure trades. Avoid withdrawing bids to maintain market presence. Monitor for any changes in ask prices or trade volume to adjust bidding increments if needed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered between $84.9 and $84.92; lowest asks are steady at $84.93-$84.94. Sellers resist lowering asks, maintaining strong pricing. Trades occur near $84.9-$84.93. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a $0.01 increment bid above the highest bid secures top position and trade likelihood while preserving margin. The ask resistance limits margin expansion. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $84.93 to stay top in bid queue, avoid withdrawing bids to maintain presence. Monitor changes in ask prices or trade activity for future adjustments.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stays between $84.9 and $84.92; lowest asks persist at $84.93; sellers do not lower asks below $84.93. Trades consistently happen near $84.93. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid at $84.93 keeps us competitive and profitable. Increasing bids above $84.93 risks margin erosion without guarantee of securing better trades. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $84.93 to hold the top bid position and maximize trade likelihood. Avoid bid withdrawal to maintain market presence. Watch for any shifts in ask prices or competitor bids for potential adjustments.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at $84.91-$84.93; lowest asks have increased to $88.5 and above, with no sellers lowering asks close to $84.93 in this hour. Trades are occurring near $84.93 but ask prices are moving upwards, reducing immediate trade opportunities. #### Thoughts: The increase in lowest asks to $88.5 reduces immediate trade opportunities at current bid levels, so maintaining $84.93 keeps us ready for any ask drops without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $84.93 to maintain top position and market presence. Watch for any ask price reductions or aggressive competitor bids in the final hour to adjust bid accordingly, balancing profit and trade likelihood.

{
  "reflection": "Throughout the auction, maintaining a bid just above the highest competing bids near $84.90-$84.93 secured multiple trades at profitable prices below our true value of $100.0. However, as ask prices increased significantly above $88.5 in recent hours, immediate trade opportunities diminished despite holding a top bid position. An improvement could have been to gradually increase bids closer to the rising asks in later hours to capture potential trades rather than holding steady too long.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With final hour approaching and no sellers lowering asks near our bid price, I will maintain the bid at $84.93 to keep the highest bid position and be ready for any unexpected ask reductions or last-minute trades. This balances profit retention with trade likelihood in a market where asks have jumped sharply.",
  "bid": 84.93,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 sees the bid queue stable with our bid at $84.93 competing alongside others, while the lowest asks remain high at $88.5 and above. I placed a bid at $84.93 to maintain the top bid position.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at $84.91-$84.93; lowest asks have risen sharply to $88.5+. Trades near $84.93 have slowed due to wide ask-bid spread. #### Thoughts: Elevated asks limit immediate trade opportunities; holding bid at $84.93 preserves margin and readiness for any ask price drops. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.93 to retain highest bid position and market presence in final hour. Monitor for any sudden ask reductions or competitor bid changes to adjust strategy quickly if needed."
