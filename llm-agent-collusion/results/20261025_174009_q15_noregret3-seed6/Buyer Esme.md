# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed opening bid at 82.61, which is marginally above the highest existing bid in the queue. Observed a wide spread with asks starting at 96.35 and bids around 81.39-83.73.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.5 to 84.0, asks remain high (lowest at 91.0), and no trades have yet occurred. I placed a bid at 84.01, just above the highest bid of 84.0 to improve priority.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered just above 84 with a highest bid at 84.25 and asks ranged widely from 89.5 to 98.3. I placed a bid at 85.50 to increase competitiveness and close the bid-ask spread gap.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I observed the bid queue highest bid at 84.5 and asks still high at 89.0 and above. I placed a bid of 85.51 to improve competitiveness and attempt to narrow the spread.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed opening bid at 82.61, which is marginally above the highest existing bid in the queue. Observed a wide spread with asks starting at 96.35 and bids around 81.39-83.73.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.5 to 84.0, asks remain high (lowest at 91.0), and no trades have yet occurred. I placed a bid at 84.01, just above the highest bid of 84.0 to improve priority.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered just above 84 with a highest bid at 84.25 and asks ranged widely from 89.5 to 98.3. I placed a bid at 85.50 to increase competitiveness and close the bid-ask spread gap.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I observed the bid queue highest bid at 84.5 and asks still high at 89.0 and above. I placed a bid of 85.51 to improve competitiveness and attempt to narrow the spread.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at $84.60 in Hour 5 to maintain competitiveness just above the highest bid of $84.55, while asks remain clustered above $88.50 with no trades yet this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid at $84.60, maintaining the highest bid level alongside buyers Dev and Ravi. The ask queue remains high starting at $88.89, and no trades occurred this hour.

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Luca at $84.0
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Amir at $84.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highest bid now $84.60, asks still firm above $88.89, no new trades this hour. Incremental bid increases have secured two trades at $84.0 but ask prices remain resistant to decline. #### Thoughts: Sellers hold firm on ask prices, requiring patient incremental bid increases to maintain priority without sacrificing margin. The spread remains wide and no immediate signs of seller capitulation. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.60 to signal readiness to pay slightly more while preserving profitability. Monitor market closely for any shift in ask prices or competitor bids. Prepare to increase bids moderately if sellers do not soften in next hours, balancing trade execution against profit margins.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highest bid stable at $84.60; asks remain above $88.79 with no downward movement; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain patient and firm, indicating that incremental bid increases above $84.60 risk margin erosion without guaranteeing trades. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.60 to sustain market presence and monitor ask price behavior closely. Prepare to increase bids moderately if sellers show no signs of softening after next hour, balancing trade execution with profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue highest bids nudged slightly higher among competitors, but my bid remains competitive at $84.60; ask prices persistent above $88.65 with no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue firm pricing; maintaining bid avoids margin loss while keeping market presence; competitors slightly increasing bids signals their willingness to pay more, but sellers not budging. #### Updated Strategy: Sustain $84.60 bid this hour to preserve margin and observe seller behavior; prepare to moderately increase bid if seller ask prices remain static after next hour, balancing trade urgency and profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.5 to 84.0, asks remain high (lowest at 91.0), and no trades have yet occurred. I placed a bid at 84.01, just above the highest bid of 84.0 to improve priority.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remained clustered just above 84 with a highest bid at 84.25 and asks ranged widely from 89.5 to 98.3. I placed a bid at 85.50 to increase competitiveness and close the bid-ask spread gap.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I observed the bid queue highest bid at 84.5 and asks still high at 89.0 and above. I placed a bid of 85.51 to improve competitiveness and attempt to narrow the spread.
Hour 5: Placed a bid at $84.60 in Hour 5 to maintain competitiveness just above the highest bid of $84.55, while asks remain clustered above $88.50 with no trades yet this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid at $84.60, maintaining the highest bid level alongside buyers Dev and Ravi. The ask queue remains high starting at $88.89, and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue highest bid remains $84.60, with sellers holding firm above $88.79. No trades occurred this hour. I placed a bid at $84.60 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 8: Placed a bid at $84.60 to maintain top buyer position; observed ask prices remain steady above $88.7 with no trades this hour.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid queue highest bid remained at $84.60 with multiple buyers tied, and ask prices persisted above $88.69. No trades occurred. I maintained my bid at $84.60.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, the bid queue shows highest bids at $84.65 and above by other buyers, with my bid steady at $84.60. The ask queue remains unchanged, starting at $88.65 and above. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, sellers held firm with asks starting at $88.61 and above. Bids pushed slightly higher with highest at $84.85 by Buyer Dev. I placed a bid at $84.85 to match the top bid.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, buyers maintained bids tightly between 84.4 and 84.86 while sellers stayed firm at asks above 88.59. I placed a bid at 84.90 to improve competitiveness.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Luca at $84.0
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Amir at $84.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold asks stubbornly above 88.59; no trades since Hour 5; buyers’ highest bids clustered around 84.85-84.86; my bid at 84.85 matched top but no fill. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not closed the spread or triggered trades; sellers are not lowering price; market shows a wide bid-ask gap limiting trade frequency; need to balance margin preservation with urgency as time runs short. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid slightly to 84.90 to outbid rivals and improve trade likelihood while maintaining a margin buffer; monitor for any seller ask drops; prepare to escalate bids more aggressively in next hours if no trades occur to secure necessary trades before Hour 15 closes.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Luca at $84.0
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Amir at $84.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold firm with asks above $88.57; buyers' highest bids tightly clustered around $84.9; no trades in several hours; bid-ask spread remains wide, limiting trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not closed the spread or induced sellers to lower prices; sellers' resistance suggests strong market power or low willingness to sell at current bids; time is running short to secure trades. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid at $84.91 to outbid rivals with minimal margin sacrifice, aiming to improve trade likelihood; monitor for ask price drops or any trade; prepare to escalate bids further in final two hours if no trades occur to ensure necessary purchases before Hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Sellers persistently hold firm with asks above 88.55; buyers' top bids tightly cluster around 84.9 to 84.95; no recent trades; bid-ask spread remains too wide to induce trade. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases so far have failed to induce seller concession or trades; sellers show strong resistance and market power; time is short with only one hour remaining after this. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.91 to keep top priority and minimize margin loss; closely observe any ask price changes or trade signals; prepare to escalate bid substantially in final hour if no trades occur to ensure necessary purchases before market closes.
