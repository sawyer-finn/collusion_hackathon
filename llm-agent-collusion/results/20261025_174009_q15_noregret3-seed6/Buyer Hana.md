# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.75, slightly above the highest current bid of $83.73, signaling intent to compete aggressively while maintaining a buffer below my true value of $100.
Hour 2: Hour 2 observed bids clustering around $83.75 to $84.0 with asks still significantly higher in the $91.0 to $98.3 range, no trades yet. I raised my bid to $84.25 to strengthen market presence.
Hour 3: Hour 3 observed bids clustering around 83.8 to 84.25 with asks still high above 89.5. I increased my bid to 84.40 to maintain top buyer position and encourage market movement.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, bids remain clustered around 84.0 to 84.5, with my bid at 84.55 being the highest among buyers, while asks still hold above 89.0, resulting in no trades today.

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Nia at $83.58
Hour 6: You bought from Seller Nia at $83.6





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices continue a slow upward trend led by my bid at 84.65, with competing buyers clustered just below. Sellers' asks remain high above 88.5, keeping the spread wide and trading stalled. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases effectively maintain top buyer status and signal seriousness without sacrificing margin. Sellers are not yet pressured to lower asks significantly. #### Updated Strategy: Slightly increase bid to 84.70 to maintain lead and encourage ask reductions. Continue monitoring ask price behavior closely to decide if more aggressive bidding is necessary in later hours. Preserve margin while ensuring market presence until asks approach a closer range.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids show a slow upward trend with my bid leading around 84.75-84.8; sellers' asks remain high above 88.7, sustaining a wide spread and low trade frequency. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep my market presence strong and bids competitive without sacrificing margin; sellers remain unyielding, so no trades beyond my recent purchases. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $84.80 to sustain demand signals and encourage ask reductions. Monitor ask price changes for signs of narrowing spread or willingness to trade. Remain patient but ready to adjust strategy if sellers lower asks or if competitive pressures from other buyers intensify.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices continue slow incremental increases led by me at $84.85, highest among buyers. Sellers remain rigid with asks above $88.69, no narrowing of spread observed. Trade activity limited to previous hours with moderate margins. #### Thoughts: Maintaining lead bid sustains market presence and signals strong demand; sellers' high ask prices limit trades at current price points. Incremental bid increases preserve profitability while encouraging seller response. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small bid increases to $84.85 to maintain leadership and test seller willingness to lower asks. Monitor ask queue closely for any signs of spread tightening or heightened buyer competition. Remain patient but ready to adjust bid aggressively if sellers begin to reduce ask prices or if competitive pressure from other buyers intensifies.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices continue slow incremental increases led by me at $84.90, highest among buyers. Sellers hold firm asks above $88.65, keeping the spread wide and limiting trades. Buyer bids cluster tightly below $85, indicating cautious buyer behavior. #### Thoughts: Maintaining lead bid sustains strong market presence and tests sellers' willingness to lower asks. Sellers' reluctance to drop asks suggests strong supply side confidence or inventory constraints. Incremental bid increases preserve profit margins while signaling demand. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small bid increases to just below $85 to maintain leadership and encourage ask price reductions. Monitor ask queue for any signs of spread narrowing or seller weakening. Stay patient but prepared to adjust bid more aggressively if sellers begin lowering asks or if buyer competition intensifies.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices remain tightly clustered just below $85, with my bid at $85.00 as the highest; sellers persist with asks above $88.59, maintaining a wide spread and limited trade activity. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases sustain market presence and test sellers' ask flexibility without eroding profit margins. Sellers' firm asks indicate strong supply confidence or inventory constraints. Buyer bids show cautious behavior, reflecting uncertainty or risk aversion. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small, steady bid increments to $85.00 to reinforce leadership and nudge sellers toward lowering asks. Remain patient and watch for signs of ask price weakening or increased buyer competition. Prepare to escalate bids more aggressively if the spread remains stubborn or if approaching final hours suggests urgency to secure trades.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices remain tightly clustered just below $85, with my bid now at $85.05 as the highest; sellers continue to hold firm asks above $88.57, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread and limited trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain market leadership and test sellers' flexibility; however, ask prices show strong resistance to downward movement, indicating supply confidence or constrained inventory. Buyers remain cautious, limiting aggressive competition. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small bid increments to just above $85.00 to sustain leadership and encourage sellers to reduce asks. Maintain patience and readiness to escalate bids more aggressively if no ask price movement occurs or if approaching final hours necessitate securing trades to maximize profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid prices continue tightly clustered below $85.10 with my new highest bid; sellers maintain asks firmly above $88.55, keeping the spread wide and limiting trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering asks, possibly due to confidence in market value or limited supply; buyers remain cautious. My incremental bid increases maintain leadership but have not yet triggered ask reductions. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to $85.10 to sustain market leadership and signal willingness to pay more, aiming to pressure sellers before the final hour. Prepare to escalate bid more aggressively if no narrowing of ask prices occurs in Hour 15 to secure trades while balancing profitability.
