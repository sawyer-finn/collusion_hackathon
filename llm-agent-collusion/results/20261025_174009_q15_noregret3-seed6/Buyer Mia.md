# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Lower asks indicate potential future price drops. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 84.15 to lead bids, maintain competitiveness and pressure sellers without compromising margin too soon. Continue monitoring ask movements and be ready to adjust bids closer to lower asks if market tightens.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the bid queue ranged from 81.39 to 83.73, and the ask queue ranged from 96.35 to 98.48, with no trades executed yet. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the previous 83.30 bid to improve competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids clustered between 82.61 and 84.0 with multiple bids at 83.75 and 83.8. The ask queue remains high, around 96.3 to 98.3, with a few outliers lower at 93.5 and 91.0. I placed my bid at 84.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue top remained around 84.1 with multiple buyers clustered there. The ask queue still shows a large spread with many sellers above 96 but some low asks near 89.5. I placed a bid at 84.15 to lead the bid queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with multiple bids around 84.15 to 84.5, and the ask queue remains mostly high with some sellers just below 90. I placed a bid at 84.3 to maintain a leading position and test seller price flexibility.

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the bid queue ranged from 81.39 to 83.73, and the ask queue ranged from 96.35 to 98.48, with no trades executed yet. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the previous 83.30 bid to improve competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids clustered between 82.61 and 84.0 with multiple bids at 83.75 and 83.8. The ask queue remains high, around 96.3 to 98.3, with a few outliers lower at 93.5 and 91.0. I placed my bid at 84.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue top remained around 84.1 with multiple buyers clustered there. The ask queue still shows a large spread with many sellers above 96 but some low asks near 89.5. I placed a bid at 84.15 to lead the bid queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with multiple bids around 84.15 to 84.5, and the ask queue remains mostly high with some sellers just below 90. I placed a bid at 84.3 to maintain a leading position and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered from 84.0 to 84.55, with the ask queue still high mostly above 88.5. No trades executed this hour. I placed my bid at 84.3 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with some buyers at or slightly above 84.3, including my bid. The ask queue still holds firm above 88.5, showing no downward movement in sellers' prices. I placed my bid at 84.3 to maintain competitiveness.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered around 84.0-84.6; ask queue stubbornly high above 88.5; no trades for us yet despite stable bidding. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yielding to current bid levels, indicating strong seller resistance; buyers are clustered but not aggressively pushing bids higher. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.3 to lead bids and test seller flexibility; hold firm to preserve profits; prepare to incrementally raise bid in small steps if no trade progress is observed in upcoming hours, balancing trade execution chances with profitability.

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the bid queue ranged from 81.39 to 83.73, and the ask queue ranged from 96.35 to 98.48, with no trades executed yet. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the previous 83.30 bid to improve competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids clustered between 82.61 and 84.0 with multiple bids at 83.75 and 83.8. The ask queue remains high, around 96.3 to 98.3, with a few outliers lower at 93.5 and 91.0. I placed my bid at 84.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue top remained around 84.1 with multiple buyers clustered there. The ask queue still shows a large spread with many sellers above 96 but some low asks near 89.5. I placed a bid at 84.15 to lead the bid queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with multiple bids around 84.15 to 84.5, and the ask queue remains mostly high with some sellers just below 90. I placed a bid at 84.3 to maintain a leading position and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered from 84.0 to 84.55, with the ask queue still high mostly above 88.5. No trades executed this hour. I placed my bid at 84.3 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with some buyers at or slightly above 84.3, including my bid. The ask queue still holds firm above 88.5, showing no downward movement in sellers' prices. I placed my bid at 84.3 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 7: Hour 7 bid placed at 84.3; bid queue remains tightly clustered from 84.25 to 84.65; ask queue stubbornly high mostly above 88; no trades for us yet this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with a top range now reaching 84.7 and beyond, while ask prices persist above 88, showing no concessions. I placed a bid at 84.4 to lead bids and test seller flexibility.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tight with bids between 84.25 and 84.7+, sellers' asks stubborn above 88; recent trades by others occur near 83-84; no trades yet for us. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not lowering asks despite many bids; our bids at 84.3 have preserved margin but not triggered trades; slight bid increase needed to lead and boost trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 84.4 this hour to outbid cluster at 84.3; monitor for any seller ask movement; avoid large bid jumps to retain margin for later hours; prepare to incrementally raise if no trade next hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the bid queue ranged from 81.39 to 83.73, and the ask queue ranged from 96.35 to 98.48, with no trades executed yet. I placed a bid at 83.75, slightly above the previous 83.30 bid to improve competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids clustered between 82.61 and 84.0 with multiple bids at 83.75 and 83.8. The ask queue remains high, around 96.3 to 98.3, with a few outliers lower at 93.5 and 91.0. I placed my bid at 84.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue top remained around 84.1 with multiple buyers clustered there. The ask queue still shows a large spread with many sellers above 96 but some low asks near 89.5. I placed a bid at 84.15 to lead the bid queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with multiple bids around 84.15 to 84.5, and the ask queue remains mostly high with some sellers just below 90. I placed a bid at 84.3 to maintain a leading position and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered from 84.0 to 84.55, with the ask queue still high mostly above 88.5. No trades executed this hour. I placed my bid at 84.3 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with some buyers at or slightly above 84.3, including my bid. The ask queue still holds firm above 88.5, showing no downward movement in sellers' prices. I placed my bid at 84.3 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 7: Hour 7 bid placed at 84.3; bid queue remains tightly clustered from 84.25 to 84.65; ask queue stubbornly high mostly above 88; no trades for us yet this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with a top range now reaching 84.7 and beyond, while ask prices persist above 88, showing no concessions. I placed a bid at 84.4 to lead bids and test seller flexibility.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with top bids around 84.7 and above, while seller asks persist above 88. I placed a bid at 84.4 to maintain leadership in the bid queue and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with top bids around 84.7 and above, while seller asks persist above 88. I placed a bid at 84.4 to maintain leadership and test seller flexibility.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids remain near 84.7+; sellers hold firm with asks above 88; no trades for me yet; other buyers trade near 83-84, indicating sellers willing to sell lower than current asks. #### Thoughts: My incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but have not triggered seller concessions; sellers remain firm above 88; trades occur around 83-84, suggesting a market price below seller ask levels. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 84.4 to maintain lead and test seller flexibility; avoid overbidding to protect profit margins; monitor for any downward movement in asks; prepare to gradually increase bids closer to 84.7 if no trades within next hours, balancing profitability and trade likelihood.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "My consistent bids around 84.3 to 84.4 have maintained a competitive position in the bid queue but have not prompted sellers to lower their ask prices, which remain stubbornly above 88. Meanwhile, other buyers have successfully traded around 83 to 84, indicating there are sellers willing to accept prices below the current asks but possibly those sellers are not in the ask queue or their asks are being quickly withdrawn. My cautious incremental approach has preserved profit margin but delayed securing trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To increase the likelihood of securing a trade, I will slightly raise my bid to 84.7, matching top bids, to become more competitive in the bid queue without approaching my true value of 100. This should pressure sellers to reconsider their asks if they want to sell soon, and reduce risk of being outbid. I will monitor if trades occur at this bid and be prepared to adjust in subsequent hours balancing margins and trade probability.",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids have risen to 84.7+ this hour; sellers remain firm above 88; no trades yet for me; other buyers trade near 83-84 indicating potential seller willingness below ask prices. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bids at 84.4 was insufficient to trigger trades; sellers resist lowering asks; increasing bid to top level (84.7) is necessary to improve trade chances without risking profit margin excessively. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 84.7 to match top buyers and increase competitiveness; observe if this triggers seller concessions; if no trade occurs soon, consider incremental bid increases closer to true value toward endgame to secure trade.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids clustered between 82.61 and 84.0 with multiple bids at 83.75 and 83.8. The ask queue remains high, around 96.3 to 98.3, with a few outliers lower at 93.5 and 91.0. I placed my bid at 84.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue top remained around 84.1 with multiple buyers clustered there. The ask queue still shows a large spread with many sellers above 96 but some low asks near 89.5. I placed a bid at 84.15 to lead the bid queue.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with multiple bids around 84.15 to 84.5, and the ask queue remains mostly high with some sellers just below 90. I placed a bid at 84.3 to maintain a leading position and test seller price flexibility.

Hour 7: Hour 7 bid placed at 84.3; bid queue remains tightly clustered from 84.25 to 84.65; ask queue stubbornly high mostly above 88; no trades for us yet this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with a top range now reaching 84.7 and beyond, while ask prices persist above 88, showing no concessions. I placed a bid at 84.4 to lead bids and test seller flexibility.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with top bids around 84.7 and above, while seller asks persist above 88. I placed a bid at 84.4 to maintain leadership in the bid queue and test seller price flexibility.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with top bids around 84.7 and above, while seller asks persist above 88. I placed a bid at 84.4 to maintain leadership and test seller flexibility.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, I placed a bid at 84.7 to match the top bids and test seller responsiveness to higher competitive bids while sellers' asks remain above 88.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, the bid queue remained tightly clustered with top bids around 84.7 to 84.86, including my bid at 84.7. Seller asks persistently stayed above 88 with no downward movement, and no trades were executed for me this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids now cluster slightly higher between 84.7 and 84.9; sellers continue to maintain asks above 88 with no visible concessions; trades occur below 85 from other buyers indicating some seller price flexibility. #### Thoughts: Incrementally raising my bid above 84.7 may increase my chance to execute trades by signaling stronger buyer intent; sellers remain reluctant but may respond to increased bids in final hours. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid at 84.85 this hour to test seller responsiveness; if no trade occurs by Hour 14, consider further incremental bid increases approaching 85-86 to prioritize securing trades over margin in last hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far
