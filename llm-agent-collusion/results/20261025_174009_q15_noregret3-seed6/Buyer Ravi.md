# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00, above the highest current bid of $83.73, but no trades occurred as asks remain above $96.35.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $85.25, positioning just above previous bids in the queue. Observed asks remain high with lowest at $91.00 (Seller Amir), no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered around $84.25 and the lowest ask remains high at $89.50. I placed a bid at $84.30 to improve queue position while maintaining a margin below the lowest ask.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $84.31 to improve queue position slightly above the highest current bids clustered at $84.3.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $83.88





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered between $84.0 and $84.6, lowest ask remains high at $88.99 with no trades. Sellers maintain high ask prices creating a wide spread. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have secured best queue position but have not narrowed the spread enough to trigger trades. Sellers are not yet incentivized to reduce asks significantly. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $84.60 to keep top position and preserve margin, signaling willingness to pay near upper cluster; observe if sellers react by lowering asks. If asks remain static, consider moderate bid increases in future hours to push market closer to trade, but avoid aggressive bids that erode profitability prematurely.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $83.88





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered $84.4-$84.76; my bid steady at $84.75, top among buyers. Seller asks remain stubbornly high at $88.59-$88.99; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not induced sellers to lower asks or produce trades. Maintaining bid position signals readiness to pay more, but sellers hold firm. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $84.75 to retain top queue position and preserve margin. Prepare to increment bid cautiously if no trades occur soon, especially as the time horizon shortens, balancing profitability and trade execution.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $83.88





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $84.75 as the highest. Seller asks remain firm and high, between $88.55 and $88.99, with no trades occurring this hour again. #### Thoughts: Sellers' reluctance to lower ask prices and no trades despite my top bid indicate a persistent supply-demand gap. Incremental bid increases have not improved trade likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Retain bid at $84.75 to maintain queue position and maximize margin. Closely monitor ask prices for any downward movement. Prepare to cautiously increase bid in the final hour if no trades occur, weighing urgency to trade against profit preservation.

````json
{
  "reflection": "Incremental increases in bids over past hours have maintained my top position in the queue but have not resulted in trades, as seller asks remain stubbornly high above $88.5. My initial bid at $84.00 was too low to prompt trades, and small bid increments have not closed the gap. Waiting has preserved margins but at the cost of no transactions except one early trade at $83.88.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I must balance urgency to secure a trade with profitability. The lowest ask is $88.53, significantly above my bid. To have a chance at trading, I should consider a more substantial bid increase closer to $85.50, still well below my true value of $100, to improve competitiveness and potentially entice sellers to lower asks or match bids. However, I will not exceed $85.50 to protect profit margins.",
  "bid": 85.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I raised my bid to $85.50, increasing competitiveness above prior bids clustered around $84.75. Seller asks remain firm, with the lowest at $88.53. No trades occurred yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain high between $88.53 and $98.3, with no downward movement despite my top bids. Bid queue is clustered below $85. My bid at $84.75 held top position but no trades resulted. #### Thoughts: Small bid increments have not moved the market or triggered trades. Sellers are firm in ask prices, possibly expecting higher bids. With the final hour now, a more significant bid increase is needed to signal buying intent and pressure sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.50 to improve position and signal urgency, still maintaining a margin below the lowest ask price to avoid overpayment. This may prompt sellers to lower asks or match bids, enabling trade before market closes."
