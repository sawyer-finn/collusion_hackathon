# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given that my true value is $100 and the lowest asks are around $96.41 to $98.69, bidding too low will likely result in no trades. However, bidding too close to the ask will reduce profit margins. I will place a bid slightly above the highest current bid (82.62) to improve my bid queue position while maintaining a conservative margin. This will help test the market willingness to trade upwards without sacrificing too much profit early in the game.",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.80, just above the highest bid of $82.62, maintaining a conservative approach while positioning competitively in the bid queue. No trades occurred in Hour #1.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.85 to maintain competitive positioning in the bid queue while no trades occurred. The ask prices remain high above $96, maintaining a wide spread.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $84.30, slightly above the highest bid of $84.25, to gain better positioning and test buyer willingness to increase bids amidst wide ask spreads.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at $87.75, surpassing the highest current bid of $87.5 in an attempt to improve positioning and approach the ask prices which remain high above $89.

Hour 4: You bought from Seller Wei at $86.62

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue maximum remains at $86.0 with my bid slightly higher at $86.10; sellers still hold high ask prices, lowest around $86.5; no trades triggered yet this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness without sacrificing margin; sellers remain firm, so patience and small steps necessary; market spread remains wide but may narrow near hour 15. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to increase bids cautiously just above highest bids to test market limits and stay competitive; monitor ask price movements carefully; prepare for more aggressive adjustments if trade activity remains low as time horizon shrinks.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid remains just above 86.1; ask prices still high near 89.3; no trades triggered this hour despite my competitive bid. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but no narrowing in ask prices; sellers remain firm; time horizon requires balancing margin with securing trades; the market spread remains wide and persistent. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above highest bid to 86.20 to maintain top position and test market responsiveness; prepare to adjust more aggressively if ask prices drop or if trades remain scarce as Hour 15 approaches; continue monitoring spreads closely and be ready to withdraw bid if market conditions worsen.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Highest bid now at 86.3, ask prices still well above 89; no trades triggered despite top bid status; sellers remain firm, spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness and test market without eroding margin; sellers not responding to current bids; time horizon limited, so will need to prepare for more aggressive bidding if spread does not tighten soon. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to 86.3 this hour to hold top position; watch for any ask price drops; if spread remains wide and no trades occur by Hour 12, plan to escalate bids more aggressively to secure trades before Hour 15; consider bid withdrawal if spread further widens to protect margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

{
  "reflection": "Previous incremental bid increases maintained top position but failed to induce seller price concessions or trigger trades, indicating seller resistance and wide bid-ask spread. Earlier bids near $86.5 secured no trades, highlighting the need to reconsider price aggressiveness or strategy given the persistent spread and limited remaining time.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maintain market presence and test seller flexibility, place a bid slightly above the current highest bid of $86.6 at $86.65. This moderate increase balances competitiveness with margin preservation. Avoid withdrawing the bid this hour to keep leverage while observing any seller response or narrowing ask prices. Prepare to escalate bid more aggressively next hour if no trade occurs, considering approaching mid-80s to improve trade likelihood before final hour.",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.
