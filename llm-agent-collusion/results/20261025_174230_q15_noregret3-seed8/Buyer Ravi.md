# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

The spread suggests patience is needed but without large jumps to avoid overpaying. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $83.96 to outbid $83.95 cluster, maintain queue priority, and monitor any drop in asks or trades. Stay patient but ready to adjust if sellers lower prices or trades start occurring.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.41 to $83.71 and asks from $96.28 to $98.67. I placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest existing bid, to position myself competitively without overpaying.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustering below $84 and asks still quite high, ranging mostly above $96 except one low ask at $89. I placed a bid at $83.90, slightly above the previous highest bid to improve my queue position.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows multiple bids at $83.95 and one at $84.25. The lowest ask remains high at $88.5. I placed a bid at $83.96 to maintain competitiveness just above $83.95.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids clustered from $83.25 to $85.75 with my previous bid at $83.96 holding a competitive position. Asks remain high, from $93.5 to $97.58, with no trades occurring near my bid. I placed my bid at $84.00 to maintain competitiveness.

Monitor for any narrowing of ask prices or trade activity, preparing to increase bid more aggressively if sellers begin to lower asks."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.41 to $83.71 and asks from $96.28 to $98.67. I placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest existing bid, to position myself competitively without overpaying.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustering below $84 and asks still quite high, ranging mostly above $96 except one low ask at $89. I placed a bid at $83.90, slightly above the previous highest bid to improve my queue position.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows multiple bids at $83.95 and one at $84.25. The lowest ask remains high at $88.5. I placed a bid at $83.96 to maintain competitiveness just above $83.95.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids clustered from $83.25 to $85.75 with my previous bid at $83.96 holding a competitive position. Asks remain high, from $93.5 to $97.58, with no trades occurring near my bid. I placed my bid at $84.00 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered mostly between $83.9 and $86.0 with my bid at $84.0 among them. Asks remain high, above $95.5, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $84.10 to slightly improve my competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, bids remain clustered between $84.0 and $86.2 with my bid at $84.20, still below the main bid cluster top. Asks remain high, all above $96, with no trades occurring this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains tightly between $84.0 and $86.2, my bid at $84.20 is competitive but still lower than many top bids. Asks remain firm and high above $96, no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain high ask prices, indicating optimism or resistance to price drops. Incremental bid increases are cautious and maintain profit margin but have not yet induced seller movement. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above current low cluster to $84.20 to try to improve queue position while balancing risk. Monitor for any narrowing of ask prices or trade activity, preparing to increase bid more aggressively if sellers begin to lower asks.

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.41 to $83.71 and asks from $96.28 to $98.67. I placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest existing bid, to position myself competitively without overpaying.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustering below $84 and asks still quite high, ranging mostly above $96 except one low ask at $89. I placed a bid at $83.90, slightly above the previous highest bid to improve my queue position.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows multiple bids at $83.95 and one at $84.25. The lowest ask remains high at $88.5. I placed a bid at $83.96 to maintain competitiveness just above $83.95.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids clustered from $83.25 to $85.75 with my previous bid at $83.96 holding a competitive position. Asks remain high, from $93.5 to $97.58, with no trades occurring near my bid. I placed my bid at $84.00 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered mostly between $83.9 and $86.0 with my bid at $84.0 among them. Asks remain high, above $95.5, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $84.10 to slightly improve my competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, bids remain clustered between $84.0 and $86.2 with my bid at $84.20, still below the main bid cluster top. Asks remain high, all above $96, with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster remains tightly packed with top bids around $86.2 and asks still high above $96. I placed a bid at $85.0 to move closer to the upper bids and increase competitiveness.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid cluster remained tight with top bids around $86.3 and my bid increased to $85.75 to better compete. Asks remain stubbornly high above $96 with no trades occurring this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster is tightly packed near $86.3; asks remain high above $96; no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases below $85.75 have not induced seller ask reductions or trades; sellers appear firm on high asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.75 to better compete with upper-middle bids and pressure sellers. Aim to test seller flexibility while maintaining profitability margin below true value. Monitor market response closely for any ask reductions or trade activity.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.41 to $83.71 and asks from $96.28 to $98.67. I placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest existing bid, to position myself competitively without overpaying.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustering below $84 and asks still quite high, ranging mostly above $96 except one low ask at $89. I placed a bid at $83.90, slightly above the previous highest bid to improve my queue position.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows multiple bids at $83.95 and one at $84.25. The lowest ask remains high at $88.5. I placed a bid at $83.96 to maintain competitiveness just above $83.95.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids clustered from $83.25 to $85.75 with my previous bid at $83.96 holding a competitive position. Asks remain high, from $93.5 to $97.58, with no trades occurring near my bid. I placed my bid at $84.00 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered mostly between $83.9 and $86.0 with my bid at $84.0 among them. Asks remain high, above $95.5, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $84.10 to slightly improve my competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, bids remain clustered between $84.0 and $86.2 with my bid at $84.20, still below the main bid cluster top. Asks remain high, all above $96, with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster remains tightly packed with top bids around $86.2 and asks still high above $96. I placed a bid at $85.0 to move closer to the upper bids and increase competitiveness.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid cluster remained tight with top bids around $86.3 and my bid increased to $85.75 to better compete. Asks remain stubbornly high above $96 with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $86.30, matching the top bid cluster. The ask queue remains stubbornly high above $96, with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, the bid cluster remained topped at $86.3 including my bid, with asks still firmly above $96 and no trades occurring. I placed my bid at $86.3 again to maintain competitiveness.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains around $86.3; asks stubbornly remain above $96 with no trades triggered by bids up to $86.3. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance, maintaining high asks far above current top bids; trading unlikely without increased seller concession or higher bids. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $86.3 to signal strong intent without eroding profit margin prematurely; closely watch for any ask reductions or trade opportunities; prepare to adjust bid upward in later hours if seller asks remain unchanged and no trades occur.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{

    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

#### Observations: Bid cluster stable at $86.3; asks remain above $96 with no concessions; no trades triggered by current bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering ask prices; bid increases up to $86.3 have not induced trades; maintaining bid preserves profit margin while signaling strong intent. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $86.3 to maintain competitive presence; avoid premature bid increases to protect profit margins; monitor for any ask price reductions or trade opportunities; prepare to incrementally increase bid closer to $87.0 or beyond in later hours if no trades occur and ask prices remain unchanged.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.41 to $83.71 and asks from $96.28 to $98.67. I placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest existing bid, to position myself competitively without overpaying.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustering below $84 and asks still quite high, ranging mostly above $96 except one low ask at $89. I placed a bid at $83.90, slightly above the previous highest bid to improve my queue position.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows multiple bids at $83.95 and one at $84.25. The lowest ask remains high at $88.5. I placed a bid at $83.96 to maintain competitiveness just above $83.95.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, bids clustered from $83.25 to $85.75 with my previous bid at $83.96 holding a competitive position. Asks remain high, from $93.5 to $97.58, with no trades occurring near my bid. I placed my bid at $84.00 to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids clustered mostly between $83.9 and $86.0 with my bid at $84.0 among them. Asks remain high, above $95.5, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at $84.10 to slightly improve my competitive position.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, bids remain clustered between $84.0 and $86.2 with my bid at $84.20, still below the main bid cluster top. Asks remain high, all above $96, with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster remains tightly packed with top bids around $86.2 and asks still high above $96. I placed a bid at $85.0 to move closer to the upper bids and increase competitiveness.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid cluster remained tight with top bids around $86.3 and my bid increased to $85.75 to better compete. Asks remain stubbornly high above $96 with no trades occurring this hour.

Hour 10: In Hour #10, the bid cluster remained topped at $86.3 including my bid, with asks still firmly above $96 and no trades occurring. I placed my bid at $86.3 again to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, the bid cluster continues around $86.3 with my bid matching this top cluster. Asks remain high above $96 with no trades occurring. I placed my bid again at $86.3.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, the bid cluster remains stable with top bids around $86.3 and asks still high above $96. I placed my bid at $86.3 to maintain competitiveness without further increasing it.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster stable between $86.3 and $86.5; asks remain firmly above $96; no trades for me yet; sellers show strong resistance to lowering ask prices. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $86.3 preserves margin and competitive presence; sellers not budging on asks suggests possible market stagnation; risk of no trades if bids remain static. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $86.3 this hour; monitor for any downward ask movements or trade activity; prepare to incrementally increase bid in Hour 14 if no change occurs to improve chances of securing a trade before market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ravi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, the bid queue shows multiple bids at $83.95 and one at $84.25. The lowest ask remains high at $88.5. I placed a bid at $83.96 to maintain competitiveness just above $83.95.

Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster remains tightly packed with top bids around $86.2 and asks still high above $96. I placed a bid at $85.0 to move closer to the upper bids and increase competitiveness.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid cluster remained tight with top bids around $86.3 and my bid increased to $85.75 to better compete. Asks remain stubbornly high above $96 with no trades occurring this hour.

Hour 12: In Hour #12, the bid cluster remains stable with top bids around $86.3 and asks still high above $96. I placed my bid at $86.3 to maintain competitiveness without further increasing it.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, bid cluster remains tight with top bids around $86.3 to $86.5; asks still high above $96 with no trades. I placed my bid at $86.3 to maintain competitiveness.
