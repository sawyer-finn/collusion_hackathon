# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightening with several buyers clustered at 85.25; highest bid now 86.5. Asks remain stubbornly high at 87.4 and above. No trades at my bid yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers show resistance to lowering asks below 87.4 despite bid increases. Incremental bid rises necessary to maintain competitive priority and push market closer to a trade. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above 85.25 cluster to 85.30 to maintain top queue position without sacrificing margin. Monitor any downward movement in asks or triggered trades to recalibrate bid increments. Focus on gradually closing bid-ask spread before later hours when urgency rises.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in the 81.67 to 83.71 range and asks in the 96.28 to 98.63 range. I placed a bid at 82.95, just above the highest standing bid to improve my position in the queue.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue tightened with bids now ranging from 82.0 to 85.0 with multiple buyers clustered near 83.75 to 85.0, and asks still broadly near 96.25 but with one outlier seller at 87.5. I placed a bid at 85.25, just above the highest current bid of 85.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids ranged from 83.5 to 86.5 with a cluster near 85.25; asks remain mostly around 87.4 to 96.19 with no trades yet. I placed a bid at 85.30, slightly above the highest cluster to improve queue position.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids clustered between 84.0 and 86.9 with multiple buyers above 85.5, and asks remained tightly grouped around 87.35 to 87.52. I placed a bid at 85.76, slightly above the previous 85.75 top bids to improve my queue position.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in the 81.67 to 83.71 range and asks in the 96.28 to 98.63 range. I placed a bid at 82.95, just above the highest standing bid to improve my position in the queue.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue tightened with bids now ranging from 82.0 to 85.0 with multiple buyers clustered near 83.75 to 85.0, and asks still broadly near 96.25 but with one outlier seller at 87.5. I placed a bid at 85.25, just above the highest current bid of 85.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids ranged from 83.5 to 86.5 with a cluster near 85.25; asks remain mostly around 87.4 to 96.19 with no trades yet. I placed a bid at 85.30, slightly above the highest cluster to improve queue position.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids clustered between 84.0 and 86.9 with multiple buyers above 85.5, and asks remained tightly grouped around 87.35 to 87.52. I placed a bid at 85.76, slightly above the previous 85.75 top bids to improve my queue position.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bids cluster tightly between 85.5 and 86.9, with asks mostly at 87.34 and a few as low as 86.95. I placed a bid at 86.96, just above the highest bid, aiming to improve my position and narrow the spread.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids range from 86.0 to 86.9 with multiple buyers at 86.9; asks are all clustered tightly around 86.94 to 86.98. I placed a bid at $86.93, just below the lowest ask to stay competitive.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.94
Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.91





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at 86.0-86.9; ask queue clustered at 86.94-86.98. Prior bid of 86.96 secured a trade at 86.94, showing seller willingness near this level. Market is still tight with little ask movement. #### Thoughts: Holding a bid just below lowest ask might encourage sellers to reduce asks or trigger trades without eroding margin too much. The spread is very narrow now, so small bid adjustments can impact trade likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 86.93 to stay competitive beneath the lowest ask, keeping margin intact and testing seller price flexibility. Monitor for any ask drops or trades to adjust upward next hour if needed.

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.94
Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.91





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bid at 86.9; ask queue lowest ask at 86.93. Previous bids just below ask secured trades near 86.9. Last bid at 86.93 did not surpass highest bid, losing top position. #### Thoughts: Gaining top queue position slightly below ask can increase trade chances without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at 86.91 to slightly outbid highest bid of 86.9 but remain below lowest ask of 86.93 to maintain competitive margin and improve trade probability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered in the 81.67 to 83.71 range and asks in the 96.28 to 98.63 range. I placed a bid at 82.95, just above the highest standing bid to improve my position in the queue.
Hour 2: At Hour 2, the bid queue tightened with bids now ranging from 82.0 to 85.0 with multiple buyers clustered near 83.75 to 85.0, and asks still broadly near 96.25 but with one outlier seller at 87.5. I placed a bid at 85.25, just above the highest current bid of 85.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids ranged from 83.5 to 86.5 with a cluster near 85.25; asks remain mostly around 87.4 to 96.19 with no trades yet. I placed a bid at 85.30, slightly above the highest cluster to improve queue position.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids clustered between 84.0 and 86.9 with multiple buyers above 85.5, and asks remained tightly grouped around 87.35 to 87.52. I placed a bid at 85.76, slightly above the previous 85.75 top bids to improve my queue position.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bids cluster tightly between 85.5 and 86.9, with asks mostly at 87.34 and a few as low as 86.95. I placed a bid at 86.96, just above the highest bid, aiming to improve my position and narrow the spread.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, bids range from 86.0 to 86.9 with multiple buyers at 86.9; asks are all clustered tightly around 86.94 to 86.98. I placed a bid at $86.93, just below the lowest ask to stay competitive.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, the bid queue has a top bid at 86.9 by Buyer Kit and the ask queue lowest ask at 86.93 by Seller Jin. I placed a bid at 86.91 to improve my position just below the lowest ask.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue shows clustered bids at 86.9 and 86.91, with the lowest ask at 86.92. I placed a bid at 86.91 to outbid the highest bid and stay just below the lowest ask.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.94

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids at 86.9 and 86.91; ask queue lowest ask at 86.92. Trades occur near 86.9 when bid is just below ask. Maintaining margin near 86.9 is feasible and effective. #### Thoughts: Staying just below lowest ask maximizes execution likelihood without sacrificing margin. Outbidding 86.9 bids by a cent improves queue position. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids at 86.91 to secure top queue position below 86.92 ask, balancing execution and profitability. Monitor for changes in ask or bid that would require adjusting bid up or down to maintain spread and queue advantage.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bid at 86.9, lowest ask at 86.91; trades occur near this tight spread. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bids at 86.91 keeps competitive edge and good queue position while preserving margin from true value 100. Outbidding 86.9 bids by a cent improves queue position and likelihood of trade. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids at 86.91 to stay just below the lowest ask, ensuring execution and profitability. Monitor changes closely and adjust bid upward or withdraw to maintain balance between margin and trade likelihood.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bid at 86.9 by Buyer Noor, lowest ask at 86.91 by Seller Mia; recent trades cluster near 86.91. Some buyers bid above 87.0 occasionally. #### Thoughts: Increasing bid modestly to 86.92 outbids highest bid at 86.9, improving queue position and chances of trade. Staying below lowest ask maintains profitability. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 86.92 to balance competitiveness with profit margin, watch for shifts in ask prices or buyers bidding over 87.0 to adjust strategy accordingly.

{

Some buyers occasionally bid just above 87.0, but the spread remains narrow. #### Thoughts: Continuing to bid 86.92 keeps me just above the main competition while preserving margin. The market is stable with minor fluctuations, so aggressive bidding above 87.0 is unnecessary currently. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.92 to stay competitive near the spread without sacrificing profit. Monitor for any upward shifts in asks or bids above 87.0 to adjust accordingly in the final hours."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bid sits at 86.9; lowest ask is 86.91. Recent trades cluster tightly around 86.91. Some buyers occasionally bid just above 87.0, but the spread remains narrow. #### Thoughts: Continuing to bid 86.92 keeps me just above the main competition while preserving margin. The market is stable with minor fluctuations, so aggressive bidding above 87.0 is unnecessary currently. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.92 to stay competitive near the spread without sacrificing profit. Monitor for any upward shifts in asks or bids above 87.0 to adjust accordingly in the final hours.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bid is 86.9, lowest ask at 86.91; recent trades continue to cluster tightly around 86.91. Bids above 87.0 exist but not dominant; the spread remains narrow and stable. #### Thoughts: Bidding at 86.92 keeps me just above main competition, preserving margin while ensuring trade opportunities. No need to push aggressively above 87.0 currently. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.92 to stay competitive near the spread without sacrificing profit. Monitor bids and asks for any signs of upward shifts to adjust bids in final hours accordingly.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bid is 86.9, lowest ask at 86.91; recent trades cluster tightly around 86.91. Several buyers now bidding above 87.0 but not yet dominant. Spread remains narrow and stable. #### Thoughts: Bidding at 86.92 maintains a leading position close to the lowest ask, preserving margin and ensuring trade opportunities. With time running short, must be ready to increase bid if competition intensifies or to secure last trades. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.92 for now; monitor market for signs of upward shifts in bids or downward shifts in asks. Prepare to increase bid in Hour 15 if needed to secure final trades without sacrificing too much profit margin.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a bid at 86.92 over the last several hours has secured consistent trades close to the lowest ask price, capturing a good balance of margin and transaction volume. However, with many buyers now bidding above 87.0, we risk losing trades if we maintain the status quo. Earlier, a slightly higher bid could have secured trades faster, but preserving margin was prudent given the spread. As the final hour approaches, securing trades becomes paramount.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize profitability by the close, I will increase my bid slightly above the highest competing bids around 87.14 to ensure purchase execution. This maintains a competitive position to secure the last trades while controlling costs below my true value of $100. I will bid 87.15 to outbid the top buyers and stay just below the highest bids, aiming to complete purchases before market closes.",
  "bid": 87.15,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, the bid queue top bid remains around 86.9 by Buyer Noor and the lowest ask is 86.91 by Seller Mia. I placed a bid at 87.15 to outbid the highest bidders and secure trades in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue top bid around 86.9; lowest ask 86.91; multiple buyers bidding above 87.0 but no dominant buyer yet; spread remains narrow but competitive. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 86.92 secured trades but risk losing final trades to higher bids; increasing bid to 87.15 will outbid current top buyers and stay below my true value, securing last trades. #### Updated Strategy: Bid 87.15 this hour to ensure execution before market closes, balancing margin and trade certainty."
