# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81.6 to 83.66 and asks ranging from 96.45 to 98.55. I placed a bid at 83.75 to be slightly above the highest current bid.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.7 to 84.0 with some buyers increasing bids slightly; I placed a bid at 83.90 to stay competitive just above the highest buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remained clustered around 83.7 to 89 with the highest competing bid at 85.0; I placed a bid at 85.25 to outbid the current highest buyers and push for a trade.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around 85.25 to 86.0 with the highest bid at 86.0. Asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, indicating sellers are not yet willing to lower prices. I placed my bid again at 85.25 to maintain competitiveness without conceding margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster tightly at 85.0 to 86.1, with no seller concessions; asks stay above 93.4, keeping wide spread. No trades at my bid suggest sellers are holding firm. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not pressured sellers to reduce asks. Maintaining bid below 86 preserves margin but reduces chance of immediate trade. Sellers likely waiting for stronger bid pressure or different market signals. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.25 to balance competitiveness and margin preservation. Avoid premature bid escalation until ask prices show signs of dropping or spread narrows. Monitor for market shifts to adjust bid strategically in subsequent hours.

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81.6 to 83.66 and asks ranging from 96.45 to 98.55. I placed a bid at 83.75 to be slightly above the highest current bid.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.7 to 84.0 with some buyers increasing bids slightly; I placed a bid at 83.90 to stay competitive just above the highest buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remained clustered around 83.7 to 89 with the highest competing bid at 85.0; I placed a bid at 85.25 to outbid the current highest buyers and push for a trade.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around 85.25 to 86.0 with the highest bid at 86.0. Asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, indicating sellers are not yet willing to lower prices. I placed my bid again at 85.25 to maintain competitiveness without conceding margin.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids remain clustered tightly between 85.0 and 86.1, with my bid at 85.25 holding steady. Seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, maintaining a wide spread and preventing trades at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains clustered around 85.25 to 86.15 with my bid steady at 85.25. Seller asks continue to hold high, mostly above 93.4, keeping the spread wide and preventing trades at my bid level.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster tightly between 85.25 and 86.15; sellers hold firm with asks mostly above 93.4, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread. No trades have occurred at my bid level. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no willingness to reduce asks significantly; incremental bid increases have not pressured sellers. Maintaining bid below 86 preserves margin but limits immediate trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to hold bid at 85.25 to balance competitiveness and margin preservation. Avoid raising bid prematurely until there are signs of ask price concessions or spread narrowing. Closely monitor market for shifts indicating potential for profitable trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81.6 to 83.66 and asks ranging from 96.45 to 98.55. I placed a bid at 83.75 to be slightly above the highest current bid.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.7 to 84.0 with some buyers increasing bids slightly; I placed a bid at 83.90 to stay competitive just above the highest buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remained clustered around 83.7 to 89 with the highest competing bid at 85.0; I placed a bid at 85.25 to outbid the current highest buyers and push for a trade.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around 85.25 to 86.0 with the highest bid at 86.0. Asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, indicating sellers are not yet willing to lower prices. I placed my bid again at 85.25 to maintain competitiveness without conceding margin.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids remain clustered tightly between 85.0 and 86.1, with my bid at 85.25 holding steady. Seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, maintaining a wide spread and preventing trades at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains clustered around 85.25 to 86.15 with my bid steady at 85.25. Seller asks continue to hold high, mostly above 93.4, keeping the spread wide and preventing trades at my bid level.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, bids remain tightly clustered between 85.25 and 86.15 with my bid now raised to 86.30 to test the market; seller asks continue to hold firm above 93.4, maintaining a wide spread.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the highest bids rose slightly to cluster between 85.4 and 86.2, with no reduction in seller asks which remain stubbornly high above 93.4. I placed a bid at 86.35 to stay just above the top buyers.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 7: You bought from Seller Bram at $84.4
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Bram at $83.42





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered between 85.4 and 86.2; sellers maintain ask prices above 93.4, preventing trades near my bid level. My previous bid at 86.3 did not induce sellers to lower asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers are unlikely to reduce asks soon; buyers show resistance around 86.2. Small bid increases are needed to maintain competitive edge and pressure sellers over time. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 86.35 to outbid current highest buyers without drastically reducing margin; continue monitoring ask prices for any sign of softening to time purchase optimally.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

This is Hour #9 out of 15 hours.

{
  "reflection": "My bids at 86.3 and 86.35 kept me consistently competitive among top buyers, enabling me to secure purchases at $84.4 and $83.42 from Seller Bram, who is pricing significantly below the main ask queue. However, the general ask prices remain high above 93.4, indicating sellers are unwilling to lower ask prices broadly, which limits trade opportunities at higher prices. I could consider slightly more aggressive bidding within a narrow margin to maintain competitiveness while preserving profitability.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the ask queue remains well above 93 and buyers cluster around 86.3 to 86.2, I will increase my bid moderately to 86.40 to outbid the current highest buyer at 86.3 (Buyer Aiko), maintaining a leading position. This small increment keeps margin intact while exerting gentle upward pressure on seller ask prices over time. I will also monitor if Seller Bram or similar low-ask sellers remain active for opportunistic trades.",
  "bid": 86.4,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 9, the bid queue tops at 86.3 with Buyer Aiko; seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, except low asks by Bram and Leo. I placed a bid at 86.40 to stay slightly above the highest buyers.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered 85.4 to 86.3; sellers hold asks above 93.4 with exceptions like Bram offering low asks near 80-84, enabling occasional trades. My bids at 86.3 and 86.35 secured trades at 84.4 and 83.42 from Bram. #### Thoughts: Sellers overall are steadfast on ask prices; buyers resist moving beyond ~86.3. Small incremental bid increases can maintain my competitive edge while preserving margin. Opportunistic trades from low ask sellers like Bram are valuable. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 86.40 to outbid highest buyer at 86.3, maintaining leadership in bid queue. Continue monitoring ask queue for any indications of sellers lowering prices; selectively capitalize on low ask sellers like Bram for profitable trades."

My bids at 86.3 and 86.35 secured trades at 84.4 and 83.42 from Bram. #### Thoughts: Sellers overall are steadfast on ask prices; buyers resist moving beyond ~86.3. Small incremental bid increases can maintain my competitive edge while preserving margin. Opportunistic trades from low ask sellers like Bram are valuable. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 86.40 to outbid highest buyer at 86.3, maintaining leadership in bid queue. Continue monitoring ask queue for any indications of sellers lowering prices; selectively capitalize on low ask sellers like Bram for profitable trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81.6 to 83.66 and asks ranging from 96.45 to 98.55. I placed a bid at 83.75 to be slightly above the highest current bid.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.7 to 84.0 with some buyers increasing bids slightly; I placed a bid at 83.90 to stay competitive just above the highest buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remained clustered around 83.7 to 89 with the highest competing bid at 85.0; I placed a bid at 85.25 to outbid the current highest buyers and push for a trade.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around 85.25 to 86.0 with the highest bid at 86.0. Asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, indicating sellers are not yet willing to lower prices. I placed my bid again at 85.25 to maintain competitiveness without conceding margin.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids remain clustered tightly between 85.0 and 86.1, with my bid at 85.25 holding steady. Seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, maintaining a wide spread and preventing trades at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains clustered around 85.25 to 86.15 with my bid steady at 85.25. Seller asks continue to hold high, mostly above 93.4, keeping the spread wide and preventing trades at my bid level.
Hour 7: At Hour 7, bids remain tightly clustered between 85.25 and 86.15 with my bid now raised to 86.30 to test the market; seller asks continue to hold firm above 93.4, maintaining a wide spread.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the highest bids rose slightly to cluster between 85.4 and 86.2, with no reduction in seller asks which remain stubbornly high above 93.4. I placed a bid at 86.35 to stay just above the top buyers.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue tops at 86.3 with Buyer Aiko; seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, except low asks by Bram and Leo. I placed a bid at 86.40 to stay slightly above the highest buyers.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, bids cluster between 85.9 and 86.35 with my bid at 86.40 to lead. Seller asks remain mostly above 93.4 except a low ask at 91.0 from Kofi, no trades yet. My bid is 86.40.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered 85.9 to 86.35; sellers mostly firm above 93.4 except low asks by Bram and Kofi; no trades at spread currently; my bid at 86.40 leads buyers.
#### Thoughts: Sellers hold firm high asks limiting trade; buyers reluctant to exceed ~86.4; incremental bid increases maintain leadership without unnecessary margin loss.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding marginally above highest buyer (86.40) to stay top bidder; watch for low ask sellers to enable profitable trades; avoid pushing bids beyond 86.40 to preserve margin; monitor ask queue closely for opportunistic buys.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 7: You bought from Seller Bram at $84.4
Hour 8: You bought from Seller Bram at $83.42
Hour 9: You bought from Seller Maya at $85.2
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.45





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered from 85.9 to 86.4 with no buyer exceeding 86.4; sellers continue to hold asks mostly above 93.4 except a few low asks from sellers like Bram and Kofi; no trades at spread currently; I remain top bidder at 86.40.
#### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain leadership without margin erosion; sellers unwilling to lower ask prices; buyers reluctant to exceed 86.4; trades occur below my bid price, preserving profitability.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.40 to lead buyers and preserve margin; watch closely for low ask sellers to enable profitable trades; avoid raising bid beyond 86.40 to prevent margin loss; consider bid withdrawal if spread remains wide and no trade opportunities arise, especially approaching final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81.6 to 83.66 and asks ranging from 96.45 to 98.55. I placed a bid at 83.75 to be slightly above the highest current bid.

Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around 85.25 to 86.0 with the highest bid at 86.0. Asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, indicating sellers are not yet willing to lower prices. I placed my bid again at 85.25 to maintain competitiveness without conceding margin.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, bids remain clustered tightly between 85.0 and 86.1, with my bid at 85.25 holding steady. Seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, maintaining a wide spread and preventing trades at my bid level.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains clustered around 85.25 to 86.15 with my bid steady at 85.25. Seller asks continue to hold high, mostly above 93.4, keeping the spread wide and preventing trades at my bid level.

Hour 8: In Hour 8, the highest bids rose slightly to cluster between 85.4 and 86.2, with no reduction in seller asks which remain stubbornly high above 93.4. I placed a bid at 86.35 to stay just above the top buyers.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue tops at 86.3 with Buyer Aiko; seller asks remain stubbornly high, mostly above 93.4, except low asks by Bram and Leo. I placed a bid at 86.40 to stay slightly above the highest buyers.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, bids cluster between 85.9 and 86.35 with my bid at 86.40 to lead. Seller asks remain mostly above 93.4 except a low ask at 91.0 from Kofi, no trades yet. My bid is 86.40.
Hour 11: Hour 11 bid placed at 86.40, bid queue remains tightly clustered from 85.9 to 86.4 led by myself and several others; sellers continue to hold high asks mostly above 93.4 with no new trades reported yet.
Hour 12: At Hour 12, bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 86.40 leading buyers. Seller asks remain high above 93.4 except for low asks from Bram and Kofi. No trades occurred at my bid this hour.

- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, the market opened with bids clustered around 81.6 to 83.66 and asks ranging from 96.45 to 98.55. I placed a bid at 83.75 to be slightly above the highest current bid.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains clustered around 83.7 to 84.0 with some buyers increasing bids slightly; I placed a bid at 83.90 to stay competitive just above the highest buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remained clustered around 83.7 to 89 with the highest competing bid at 85.0; I placed a bid at 85.25 to outbid the current highest buyers and push for a trade.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered between 85.9 and 86.5, with my bid at 86.40 leading; seller asks mostly above 93.4 except for a few low asks; no trades at my bid price; trades occur below 86.40, preserving margin. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 86.40 sustains leadership and profit margin; sellers unwilling to lower asks; bidding higher risks margin loss without assured trades; bids clustered tightly indicating strong resistance to price increase. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.40 to lead buyers and protect margins; monitor low ask sellers for profitable trades; avoid raising bid beyond 86.40; consider bid withdrawal if spread remains wide and no trades occur near bid as final hours approach.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Yara. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between 86.0 and 86.5; my bid at 86.40 leads buyers. Seller asks stubbornly high above 93.4; no trades at my bid. Past trades occur below 86.40, preserving margins. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 86.40 sustains leadership and profit margin; sellers unwilling to lower asks; raising bid risks margin loss without assured trades; tight clustering indicates resistance to price increase. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.40 to lead buyers and protect margins; monitor low ask sellers for profitable trades; avoid raising bid beyond 86.40; consider bid withdrawal if spread remains wide and no trades occur near bid as final hours approach.

{
  "reflection": "Over the past hours, maintaining a bid around 86.40 has kept me competitive among buyers and preserved profit margins, while sellers have consistently refused to lower asks below 93.4, resulting in no trades at my bid. Past successful trades were executed at prices below 86.40, indicating the market resists my current bid level. Incremental bid increases have not induced seller price reductions.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I must balance securing trades and maintaining profitability. Raising my bid beyond 86.40 risks reducing margins without guaranteed trades, as sellers\u2019 asks remain significantly higher. I will maintain my bid at 86.40 to lead buyers and monitor if sellers drop asks closer to market bids, but if the spread remains wide, I will consider withdrawing to avoid losses.",
  "bid": 86.4,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at 86.40 leading. Seller asks persist above 93.4 with no trades at my bid. I placed the bid at 86.40 again.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered between 86.0 and 86.65; my bid 86.40 leads buyers. Seller asks remain high above 93.4, no trades at my bid this hour. Past trades below 86.40 suggest resistance. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 86.40 sustains leadership and profit margins; sellers unwilling to lower asks; raising bid risks margin loss without assured trades; tight clustering shows market resistance. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.40 to lead buyers and protect margins; monitor seller ask reductions; consider bid withdrawal if spread remains wide and no trades occur near bid as final hour closes."
