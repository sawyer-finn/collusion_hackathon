# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $84.00, positioning just above the highest existing bid of $83.73 to increase our competitiveness.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue showed our bid at $84.00 competing closely with others, and asks remained high with the lowest ask at $85.5. We raised our bid slightly to $85.01 to lead the bids and test market response.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive around $85.00 with multiple buyers clustered there. The lowest asks remain above $85.45. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids clustered at $85.3 and $85.4, and sellers maintain asks above $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.40 to improve priority and test if sellers will lower asks or accept trades.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $84.00, positioning just above the highest existing bid of $83.73 to increase our competitiveness.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue showed our bid at $84.00 competing closely with others, and asks remained high with the lowest ask at $85.5. We raised our bid slightly to $85.01 to lead the bids and test market response.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive around $85.00 with multiple buyers clustered there. The lowest asks remain above $85.45. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids clustered at $85.3 and $85.4, and sellers maintain asks above $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.40 to improve priority and test if sellers will lower asks or accept trades.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bid queue remains tight with our bid at $85.40 holding top position among buyers. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.44 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at $85.40.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple bids at $85.45 and $85.46, and sellers holding asks above $85.38. I placed a bid at $85.47 to gain priority and test seller response.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered around $85.45-$85.46; sellers' lowest asks remain above $85.38 with no trades at prior bids. Recent trades mostly below $85.5 indicate seller willingness to transact but not yet at current asks. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases needed to gain priority and pressure sellers; previous bids at $85.40 held top buyer spot but failed to close trades. Sellers likely wait for better prices or prefer to hold. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally to $85.47 to gain priority and test seller response while balancing profit margin. Maintain vigilance for any ask price drops or trades. Prepare for further small increments if sellers show softening to avoid missing trading opportunities.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $84.00, positioning just above the highest existing bid of $83.73 to increase our competitiveness.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue showed our bid at $84.00 competing closely with others, and asks remained high with the lowest ask at $85.5. We raised our bid slightly to $85.01 to lead the bids and test market response.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive around $85.00 with multiple buyers clustered there. The lowest asks remain above $85.45. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids clustered at $85.3 and $85.4, and sellers maintain asks above $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.40 to improve priority and test if sellers will lower asks or accept trades.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bid queue remains tight with our bid at $85.40 holding top position among buyers. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.44 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at $85.40.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple bids at $85.45 and $85.46, and sellers holding asks above $85.38. I placed a bid at $85.47 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $85.47 holding the top buyer position. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.37 with no trades executed at my bid.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I lowered my bid slightly to $85.45, stepping back from the top bid cluster at $85.47-$85.48 to test seller reaction and potential trade opportunities.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered tightly around $85.45-$85.48 with sellers' lowest asks holding above $85.36. No trades at my previous $85.47 bid, indicating seller resistance. Recent trades mostly below $85.5. #### Thoughts: Sellers not budging at current bid levels; incremental bid increases ineffective; lowering bid slightly may encourage seller acceptance or create trade opportunities without sacrificing much profit. #### Updated Strategy: Reduce bid to $85.45 to test seller flexibility and foster trades; maintain competitiveness while avoiding overpayment; watch for any downward ask movement or trades at this level for next hour's adjustment.

#### Observations: Bid queue still clustered at $85.45-$85.48; lowest asks remain above $85.95; no trades at $85.45 bid this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to hold firm; small bid increases have not prompted seller concessions; maintaining bid at $85.45 preserves profit margin while staying competitive. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.45 to test market and avoid overpaying; watch for any seller ask reductions or trades; if no improvement by Hour 12, consider a moderate bid increase to secure trades before end of horizon.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $84.00, positioning just above the highest existing bid of $83.73 to increase our competitiveness.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue showed our bid at $84.00 competing closely with others, and asks remained high with the lowest ask at $85.5. We raised our bid slightly to $85.01 to lead the bids and test market response.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive around $85.00 with multiple buyers clustered there. The lowest asks remain above $85.45. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids clustered at $85.3 and $85.4, and sellers maintain asks above $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.40 to improve priority and test if sellers will lower asks or accept trades.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bid queue remains tight with our bid at $85.40 holding top position among buyers. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.44 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at $85.40.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple bids at $85.45 and $85.46, and sellers holding asks above $85.38. I placed a bid at $85.47 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $85.47 holding the top buyer position. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.37 with no trades executed at my bid.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I lowered my bid slightly to $85.45, stepping back from the top bid cluster at $85.47-$85.48 to test seller reaction and potential trade opportunities.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $85.45 matching others, and the lowest asks remain significantly higher at $85.96 and above, with no trades executed at my bid.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with our bid now at $85.50, slightly above previous bids. Sellers continue to hold asks firmly above $85.95 with no trades executed at our bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered at $85.45-$85.50; sellers' lowest asks remain at $85.94 or above; no trades at $85.50 bid. #### Thoughts: Sellers expect bids closer to or above $86.00; small bid increases have not prompted seller concessions; maintaining margin important given $100 true value. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.50 this hour to assert intent; monitor seller ask response; prepare for incremental bid increases to $85.60-$85.65 next hour if no improvement, aiming to secure trades before market close.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue remains competitive around $85.00 with multiple buyers clustered there. The lowest asks remain above $85.45. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with multiple bids clustered at $85.3 and $85.4, and sellers maintain asks above $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.40 to improve priority and test if sellers will lower asks or accept trades.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bid queue remains tight with our bid at $85.40 holding top position among buyers. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.44 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at $85.40.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple bids at $85.45 and $85.46, and sellers holding asks above $85.38. I placed a bid at $85.47 to gain priority and test seller response.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $85.47 holding the top buyer position. Sellers' asks continue to hold firm above $85.37 with no trades executed at my bid.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I lowered my bid slightly to $85.45, stepping back from the top bid cluster at $85.47-$85.48 to test seller reaction and potential trade opportunities.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $85.45 matching others, and the lowest asks remain significantly higher at $85.96 and above, with no trades executed at my bid.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with our bid now at $85.50, slightly above previous bids. Sellers continue to hold asks firmly above $85.95 with no trades executed at our bid.
Hour 11: At Hour 11, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid at $85.50 holding top buyer position. Sellers maintain asks firmly above $85.94 with no trades executed at my bid.
Hour 12: Hour 12: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at $85.45-$85.50 with my bid at $85.50 maintaining top buyer position; sellers continue to hold asks firmly above $85.93 with no trades executed at my bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered at $85.45-$85.50 with no trades; seller asks firmly above $85.92; no downward movement from sellers despite stable bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers are likely anchored to ask prices near $85.92, requiring bids closer to $86.00 to induce trades; incremental bid increases have not shifted seller behavior; maintaining profit margin important given true value of $100. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $85.50 this hour to maintain visibility and buyer priority; monitor seller response carefully; if no trades by Hour 14, increment bid to $85.60-$85.65 to approach seller asks and enable profitable trade execution before market close.

{

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Eli. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue clustered at $85.45-$85.50 with no trades; seller asks firmly above $85.89; sellers show no sign of lowering asks in response to bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers anchored around $85.90+; bids below $86 insufficient to trigger trades; maintaining bid at $85.50 preserves margin but risks no trade. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.50 this hour to maintain visibility and priority; monitor seller response closely; if no trades by Hour 15, increase bid to $85.60-$85.65 to approach seller asks and enable profitable trade execution before market close.

{
  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a consistent bid around $85.50 for several hours to preserve margin and test seller willingness, no trades have been executed, indicating seller ask prices remain firm above $85.88 and are unlikely to lower further. Attempts to undercut or step back in bids have not prompted seller concessions, suggesting a price floor near $85.90.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, to secure a trade and avoid zero profit, I will increase the bid to $85.60, which is still below my true value of $100 but closer to seller asks, increasing chances of execution with acceptable profitability. This balances the risk of no trade with reasonable margin retention.",
  "bid": 85.6,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, I raised the bid to $85.60 to improve competitiveness and attempt to trigger a trade as sellers maintain asks above $85.79 with no signs of lowering.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain firmly above $85.79-$85.90, no downward movement; bid cluster is tight between $85.45-$85.55; no trades executed at $85.50; sellers hold a firm price floor.\n#### Thoughts: Maintaining bids at or below $85.50 insufficient to break seller resistance; sellers unlikely to reduce asks further; risk of no trade and zero profit if bid not increased.\n#### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.60 to improve likelihood of trade execution with positive margin before market closes; accept slightly reduced profit for guaranteed trade; monitor if trade occurs and prepare to reassess in post-market analysis."
