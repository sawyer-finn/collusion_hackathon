# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from 81.39 to 83.73 and asks from 96.35 to 98.48. I placed a bid at 83.80, just above the highest competing bid.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue showed a highest bid at 85.0 by Buyer Wei. Seller asks remain mostly in mid-90s with a few outliers lower. I placed a bid of 85.05, slightly above the highest competing bid.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 85.30, just above highest competing bid of 85.25; sellers remain mostly above 85.45 with no trades yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the highest competing bids clustered mostly at 85.3 and above, with the lowest seller ask slightly reduced to 85.44. I placed a bid at 85.35, just above the highest bid of 85.3.

#### Observations: Bids are tightly grouped at 85.35-85.46; sellers maintain firm asks above 85.99; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases keep me competitive but no trades occur due to ask prices remaining high; bid-ask spread is still wide. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.46 to stay just above highest competing bids while preserving margin; monitor for seller ask adjustments or trades; prepare to raise bid gradually closer to lowest ask if no trades occur in future hours to balance profitability and trade success.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered 85.45-85.48; seller asks hold firm above 85.97; no trades for me yet despite competitive bids. #### Thoughts: Slight bid increments may increase trade chances without sacrificing too much margin; sellers have not softened asks, so patience and incremental aggression are needed. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 85.48 to stay competitive; watch seller ask movements closely; prepare to increase further if sellers do not decrease asks, balancing risk of lower profit against securing trades before Hour 15.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 6: In Hour #6, bids remain tightly clustered around 85.35 to 85.46 with my bid at 85.46, matching the highest current bids. Seller asks remain above 85.99, maintaining a wide spread with no trades involving me.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Luca at $84.75
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.31





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered 85.45-85.49; sellers maintain asks firmly above 85.95; no new trades triggered by previous small bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers appear reluctant to lower asks; small bid increments keep me competitive but may delay trades; successful trade at 84.75 shows margin potential is still present. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.51 to outbid current highest competitors and signal stronger buying intent; watch for any seller ask reductions or trades triggered; prepare to increment bids carefully in subsequent hours to balance margin preservation with trade execution urgency as final hours approach.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 9: You bought from Seller Luca at $84.75
Hour 10: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.31
Hour 11: You bought from Seller Luca at $85.01





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered 85.45-85.50; sellers maintain firm asks above 85.90; no trades triggered by previous marginal bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers reluctant to reduce asks; small bid increments maintain competitiveness but delay trades; successful trades achieved at mid-84s to 85.3 show margin potential. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.52 to outbid current highest bids and signal stronger intent; monitor seller behavior for ask reduction or trade execution; prepare for incremental bid increases in next hours to balance margin preservation with securing trades before time horizon ends.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue still tightly clustered 85.45-85.50; sellers hold firm asks at 85.92; no trade triggered by previous bid of 85.52. #### Thoughts: Sellers reluctant to lower asks; marginal bid increases maintain top position but delay trades; profitable trades occurred previously at 84.75-85.31; risk of no trades by end of hour 15 if waiting. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid from 85.52 to 85.55 to intensify pressure; signal stronger commitment to trade; monitor seller ask movement closely; prepare to increase bid further next hour if no response; aim to balance margin preservation with necessity of securing trades before market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Hana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered 85.45-85.50; sellers hold firm asks at 85.91; no trade triggered by previous bid of 85.55. #### Thoughts: Sellers are reluctant to lower asks; marginal bid increases maintain top position but delay trades; profitable trades occurred previously at 84.75-85.31; risk of no trades by end of hour 15 if waiting. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid from 85.55 to 85.56 to intensify pressure; signal stronger commitment to trade; monitor seller ask movement closely; prepare to increase bid further next hour if no response; aim to balance margin preservation with necessity of securing trades before market closes.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases have successfully maintained top bid positions but have not yet compelled sellers to lower their asks below 85.88. My trades from previous hours at prices between 84.75 and 85.31 have been profitable, yet the narrow bid-ask spread and seller resistance signal that pushing bids too close to ask prices risks eroding margin. The lack of trade triggers at bids around 85.55-85.56 indicates sellers are waiting for higher offers or prefer holding their asks.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, I must prioritize securing at least one trade, balancing profit margin and execution risk. I will increase my bid to 85.57, just above all competitors, to signal stronger buying intent and pressure sellers to transact. If this does not trigger a trade, I will accept this as the best achievable margin given market conditions and prepare to withdraw next hour if possible or hold steady. Maintaining bids below my true value of 100 preserves profitability even in a last-minute trade.",
  "bid": 85.57,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I placed a bid at 85.57, surpassing all competing bids which remain clustered below 85.56. Seller asks remain firm at 85.88 and above with no trade triggered yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered 85.45-85.55; sellers hold asks firmly at 85.88; no trade triggered at 85.55 or 85.56; previous trades profitable but no recent executions; final hour pressure rising. #### Thoughts: Sellers reluctant to lower asks; small bid increases maintain top position but delay trades; risk of missing trade if waiting too long; need to balance margin with trade certainty. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.57 to intensify pressure and signal strong commitment; aim to trigger trade before market closes; if no trade, accept margin limits; prepare for final decision next hour."
