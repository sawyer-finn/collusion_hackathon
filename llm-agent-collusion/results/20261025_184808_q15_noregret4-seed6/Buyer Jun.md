# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.80, just above the highest existing bid to be competitive at Hour #1 where the spread between bids and asks remains large.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the highest bid increased to $85.0 and the lowest ask remained at $85.5. I raised my bid to $85.6 to lead the bid queue and try to close the gap for a trade.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the highest bid clustered near $85.25 and the lowest ask remained just below $85.5. I placed a bid at $85.50, slightly above the highest bid, to lead and push for trade opportunities.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I observe the bid queue tightly clustered around $85.1 to $85.4 and the lowest ask at $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.45 to lead the bids and nudge the market toward trade.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly packed near $85.0-$85.45; lowest ask still well above at $86.0 and higher. Past bids near $85.45 have maintained leadership but trade execution is slow due to ask prices holding firm. #### Thoughts: Continuing to bid $85.45 preserves margin and market leadership while nudging sellers; however, ask prices remain sticky. Patience is required to see if sellers lower asks over time or trades occur. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.45 to lead bids, balancing competitiveness with profit margin, while monitoring for any downward movement in asks or trade executions.

Hour 3: At Hour 3, the highest bid clustered near $85.25 and the lowest ask remained just below $85.5. I placed a bid at $85.50, slightly above the highest bid, to lead and push for trade opportunities.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, I observe the bid queue tightly clustered around $85.1 to $85.4 and the lowest ask at $85.44. I placed a bid at $85.45 to lead the bids and nudge the market toward trade.
Hour 5: At Hour 5, the bid queue remained tightly clustered with my bid at $85.45 leading among several others, while the lowest asks stayed significantly higher around $86.0 and above. I placed a bid at $85.45.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around $85.45 to $85.46 with my bid at $85.45, leading among buyers below $85.46. The lowest asks remain high above $85.9, showing sellers are holding firm. I bid $85.45 to maintain leadership.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue still clustered near $85.45-$85.46; lowest asks remain well above $85.9, causing slow trade execution despite bid leadership. Sellers remain reluctant to lower asks closer to bids. #### Thoughts: Consistent bid at $85.45 preserves market leadership and profit margin; patience needed as sellers have not yet responded to bidding pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with $85.45 bid to stay competitive and profitable, while watching for any downward ask adjustments or trade opportunities to emerge.

# Market Rules

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around $85.45 to $85.46 with my bid at $85.45, leading among buyers below $85.46. The lowest asks remain high above $85.9, showing sellers are holding firm. I bid $85.45 to maintain leadership.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remained tightly clustered with our bid at $85.45 leading among buyers below $85.46, while the lowest asks persist above $85.9, indicating seller resistance. We placed our bid at $85.45 to maintain competitive positioning.
Hour 8: At Hour 8, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around $85.45-$85.48 with my bid at $85.45 leading among buyers below $85.46. The lowest asks remain high above $85.9, showing sellers are holding firmly. I bid $85.45 to maintain leadership and preserve margins.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $84.05
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $85.45-$85.48; my bid at $85.45 leads below $85.46. Lowest asks remain stubbornly above $85.9, no downward movement from sellers. No trades at current bid levels. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.45 preserves profit margins but limits trades due to wide bid-ask spread. Seller resistance is strong. Incremental bid increases by others show competition but no seller concessions. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $85.45 to lead bids and avoid margin erosion. Monitor for any ask price reductions to act quickly. Consider bid withdrawal if asks remain far above $86 to conserve resources. Prioritize maximizing profit with patience given market conditions.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

{
  "reflection": "So far, maintaining a bid around $85.45 has kept our profit margins relatively high while keeping us competitive among buyers. However, no trades have occurred at this bid level due to sellers holding firm with asks well above $85.9, creating a persistent large bid-ask spread. Incremental bid increases by other buyers have not pressured sellers to lower asks, indicating strong seller resistance.",

Avoid aggressive bid increases to prevent margin erosion while monitoring the ask queue for any downward movement. If sellers remain firm above $86, consider withdrawing the bid in future hours to conserve resources and avoid unnecessary exposure.",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $84.05
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered $85.45-$85.48 with my bid at $85.45 leading the bids below $85.46. Lowest asks stubbornly above $85.9, no downward movement from sellers. No trades at current bid level. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.45 preserves profit margins but limits trade opportunities due to wide bid-ask spread. Seller resistance remains strong; incremental bid increases by others fail to induce ask price drops. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $85.45 to maintain leadership and avoid margin erosion. Monitor ask queue closely for any price reductions to act quickly. Prepare to consider bid withdrawal if asks remain significantly above $86 to conserve resources and minimize risk. Prioritize maximizing profit with patience given current market conditions.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $84.05
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $85.45-$85.49, my bid at $85.45 leads bids below $85.46; lowest asks remain above $85.9 with no concessions from sellers. No trades at current bid level. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.45 preserves profit margins but limits trade opportunities due to wide ask-bid spread. Seller resistance remains strong; incremental bid increases by others fail to induce ask price drops. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $85.45 to maintain leadership and preserve margin. Monitor ask queue closely for any price drops. Be ready to withdraw bid if asks remain high above $86 to conserve resources and avoid risk. Prioritize maximizing profit with patience given current market conditions.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $84.05
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $85.45-$85.5 with my bid at $85.45 leading bids below $85.46; lowest asks remain stubbornly above $85.9 with no seller concessions. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.45 preserves profit margins but limits trade opportunities due to wide and persistent ask-bid spread; seller resistance remains strong. Incremental bid increases by other buyers have not induced ask price drops. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $85.45 to maintain leadership and preserve margins. Monitor ask queue closely for any price drops or shifts. Be prepared to increase bid if sellers become more competitive, especially as the final hours approach, but remain patient to maximize profitability given current market conditions.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $84.05
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $85.45-$85.5 with my bid at $85.45 leading bids below $85.46; lowest asks stubbornly above $85.9, showing no seller concession. No trades on my bids since Hour 3. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.45 preserves margins but limits trade chances due to wide spread and strong seller resistance. Incremental bid increases have failed to move sellers. Waiting conserves margin but risks missed trades if sellers stay firm. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $85.45 bid this hour to lead bids below $85.46; monitor ask prices closely. Prepare to increase bids strategically from Hour 14 onwards if sellers remain firm, balancing improved trade chances against margin preservation in final hours.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Nia at $84.05
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kofi at $85.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $85.45-$85.5 with my bid at $85.45 leading bids below $85.46; lowest asks remain stubbornly above $85.9, no seller concessions observed. No trades on my bids since Hour 3. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $85.45 preserves margin but limits trade chances in face of wide spread and firm seller resistance. Incremental bid increases have failed to move sellers. Waiting conserves margin but risks missed trades if sellers stay firm. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $85.45 bid this hour to preserve margin and market leadership. Closely monitor ask price movements. Prepare to raise bids strategically in Hour 15, balancing improved trade likelihood against margin erosion in the final hour.

## Response: Round 15 - 2026-10-25 18:49:18.470411
````json
{
  "reflection": "Maintaining the bid at $85.45 over many hours preserved margin but resulted in no trades due to persistent high ask prices above $85.9. Incremental increases in bids by others have not shifted seller behavior, indicating strong seller resistance near $85.9. Earlier, purchasing at roughly $84-$85 yielded good margins, but recent inactivity suggests a stalemate with no price convergence.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I must balance the risk of no trades against margin erosion. To increase the likelihood of securing a trade, I will raise my bid closer to the lowest ask but still below my true value of $100. I will bid $85.90 to surpass the sellers' resistance point at $85.9, aiming to lead the bid queue at a price likely to trigger a trade.",
  "bid": 85.9,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I raised my bid to $85.90 to break the long-standing price stalemate and increase chances of trade against persistent asks above $85.9.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered in mid $85 range; lowest asks stubbornly above $85.9; prior bids at $85.45 failed to induce seller concessions. #### Thoughts: Sellers have consistently resisted bids below $85.9, indicating a strong price floor. Maintaining low bids preserved margins but blocked trades. As final hour approaches, trading at slightly higher prices is necessary to secure any deals. #### Updated Strategy: In this final hour, increase bid to $85.90 to lead bids and approach seller ask price, aiming to secure trade while balancing margin loss risk. If no trade occurs, accept no trade rather than further margin erosion."
