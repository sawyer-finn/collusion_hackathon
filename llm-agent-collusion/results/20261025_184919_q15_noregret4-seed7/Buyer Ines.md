# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Opening spread is wide: bids ~$81-$83, asks ~$96-$99
- No trades yet, indicating gap too large for matches

#### Thoughts
- Need to close bid-ask spread gradually to enable trades
- Avoid bidding near true value early to preserve profit margin
- Monitor market response to incremental bid increases

#### Updated Strategy
- Incrementally increase bid to just above highest bids to signal buying interest
- Maintain bid below $85 initially to keep margin
- Reassess bids hourly based on market movements and trades
- Prioritize securing at least some trades before Hour #15 while balancing margins

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bid prices around $81-$83 and asks around $96-$99. I placed a bid at $83.70, slightly above the highest existing bids.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue shows bids clustering around $84.00 with some at $83.75 and below; the ask queue remains high with the lowest ask at $89.50 by Seller Bram, far above current bids. I placed a bid at $84.10.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 84.1 to 84.25, I placed a bid at 84.30, the highest among buyers, while the lowest asks remain around 84.5 to 100.0.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids cluster from 84.1 to 84.5 with my bid at 84.3 near the top; asks remain high, lowest at 88.25, well above bids. I increased my bid to 84.40.

#### Observations: Bids remain clustered mid-84s, with my bid now highest at 84.6.

Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue shows bids clustering around $84.00 with some at $83.75 and below; the ask queue remains high with the lowest ask at $89.50 by Seller Bram, far above current bids. I placed a bid at $84.10.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 84.1 to 84.25, I placed a bid at 84.30, the highest among buyers, while the lowest asks remain around 84.5 to 100.0.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids cluster from 84.1 to 84.5 with my bid at 84.3 near the top; asks remain high, lowest at 88.25, well above bids. I increased my bid to 84.40.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows a tight cluster around 84.3 to 84.55 with my bid raised to 84.6, the highest among buyers. Asks remain high with the lowest at 85.0, indicating sellers are starting to lower asks but still above bids.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I maintained my bid at $84.60, staying as the highest buyer amidst bids clustering in the mid-84s. The lowest asks remain well above bids, keeping the spread wide and no trades were reported.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Wei at $83.05





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered in the mid-84s with my bid steady at 84.60, highest among buyers. Lowest asks still significantly higher (85.4 and above), indicating seller resistance and a wide bid-ask spread. No trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Holding bid steady preserves profit margin and maintains competitive position without pushing sellers away. Patience is key at this stage to watch market reactions. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain current bid at 84.60 to keep top position while monitoring if sellers lower asks or trades occur. Prepare to increase bids more aggressively if no progress by midgame, balancing between securing trades and protecting profitability.

#### Observations: Bids remain clustered in the mid-84s; my bid is now slightly above the highest buyer bid at 84.66. Sellers keep asks high above 85.4, maintaining a wide spread. No trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Slightly increasing bid may signal seriousness and help narrow spread incrementally, increasing chances for a trade without sacrificing too much margin early in the time horizon. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain top bid status by bidding 84.66, monitor if sellers lower asks or trades occur.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Wei at $83.05





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered mid-84s; my bid increased to 84.75, highest among buyers. Lowest asks still above 85.25, spread remains wide, no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase maintains market leadership and signals intent to buy. Sellers not yet lowering asks, so patience with gradual increase is warranted to preserve margin early in the time horizon. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to increment bids moderately to encourage narrowing the spread. Monitor seller behavior closely; if asks remain high in coming hours, prepare for more aggressive bidding to secure trades before final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bid prices around $81-$83 and asks around $96-$99. I placed a bid at $83.70, slightly above the highest existing bids.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue shows bids clustering around $84.00 with some at $83.75 and below; the ask queue remains high with the lowest ask at $89.50 by Seller Bram, far above current bids. I placed a bid at $84.10.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain clustered around 84.1 to 84.25, I placed a bid at 84.30, the highest among buyers, while the lowest asks remain around 84.5 to 100.0.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids cluster from 84.1 to 84.5 with my bid at 84.3 near the top; asks remain high, lowest at 88.25, well above bids. I increased my bid to 84.40.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows a tight cluster around 84.3 to 84.55 with my bid raised to 84.6, the highest among buyers. Asks remain high with the lowest at 85.0, indicating sellers are starting to lower asks but still above bids.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I maintained my bid at $84.60, staying as the highest buyer amidst bids clustering in the mid-84s. The lowest asks remain well above bids, keeping the spread wide and no trades were reported.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, bids cluster in the mid-84s with my bid at 84.66, now the highest among buyers; lowest asks remain above 85.4, keeping the spread wide and no trades reported so far.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, bids cluster in the mid-84s with my bid increased to 84.75, the highest among buyers; lowest asks remain above 85.25, keeping the spread wide and no trades reported.
Hour 9: At Hour 9, I placed a bid at 84.85, remaining the highest among buyers. The bid queue shows clustering in the mid-84s, while the lowest asks hold steady above 85.0, keeping the spread wide and no trades occurring.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster mid-84s with my bid now highest at 84.90; lowest asks remain above 85.0, spread still wide; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue resisting ask price reductions; previous moderate increases preserved margins but delayed trades; stronger bidding needed to induce seller movement. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 84.90 to apply more buying pressure and encourage sellers to lower asks or execute trades; carefully balance bid increments to maintain profitability while pushing market closer to trade; monitor closely for spread narrowing or trade execution signals.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster mid-84s with my bid now highest at 84.95; lowest asks remain above 85.0, spread wide; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue resisting ask price reductions; previous moderate bid increases preserved margins but delayed trades; stronger bidding needed to induce seller movement without sacrificing too much profit. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 84.95 to apply more buying pressure and encourage sellers to lower asks or execute trades; carefully balance bid increments to maintain profitability while pushing market closer to trade; monitor closely for spread narrowing or trade execution signals.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster mid-84s to mid-85s with my bid now highest at 85.10; sellers maintain ask floor above 85.16; no trades this hour indicating seller resistance; time is running short with only two hours left. #### Thoughts: Sellers have held ask prices steady despite incremental bid increases; small bid increments have not reduced spread enough to secure trades; need to balance margin preservation with trade execution urgency. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.10 to show stronger buying interest; monitor seller reactions closely; prepare for more aggressive bidding in Hour 14 if spread remains wide; consider potential trade-offs between margin and securing lots as deadline nears.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, incremental bid increases kept me as the highest buyer but the ask prices remained stubbornly above 85.15, resulting in no trades despite narrowing the spread. This cautious approach preserved margins but risked missing out on final trades as the market showed seller resistance and no significant downward movement in asks.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and time is critical, I will increase my bid more aggressively to $85.30 to signal strong buying interest and encourage sellers to transact, balancing the need to secure trades without exceeding my true value of $100. This should improve the chance of trades while maintaining profitability.",
  "bid": 85.3,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I placed a bid at $85.30, increasing my position as the highest buyer to stimulate trade closure despite persistent seller ask prices just above 85.15.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid prices cluster mid-85s; my bid raised to 85.30 highest; asks remain just above 85.15; no trades yet in final hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers still reluctant to lower asks; final hour urgency requires stronger bid to secure trades; marginal profit preservation still possible. #### Updated Strategy: Place a more aggressive bid at 85.30 to signal willingness to transact; prepare to accept narrower margins for trade completion; monitor if sellers react positively to increased bids."
