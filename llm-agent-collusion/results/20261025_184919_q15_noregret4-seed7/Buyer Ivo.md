# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Incremental bid increases might pressure sellers or entice trades with lower ask sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $84.30 to maintain queue leadership and test sellers' willingness to drop asks, particularly targeting the low outlier ask at $84.5. Monitor carefully for any seller adjustments or trades to decide whether to accelerate or hold steady in subsequent hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $84.00 which is just above the current top bid of $83.63. The bid queue is concentrated in the 81-83 range while asks remain high in the 96-98 range.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.25, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.00, maintaining a leading position in the bid queue while no trades occurred at this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue tightened around $84.1 to $84.25 with my bid now at $84.30, still no trades occurred. Sellers hold asks mostly around $89.5 and above, with Maya's ask at $84.5 as a notable low outlier.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.35 to maintain a leading position and test seller willingness to reduce asks near $84.5. Observed bid queue remains clustered around $84.1-$84.3, and lowest ask stayed at $84.5 with other asks above $88.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $84.00 which is just above the current top bid of $83.63. The bid queue is concentrated in the 81-83 range while asks remain high in the 96-98 range.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.25, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.00, maintaining a leading position in the bid queue while no trades occurred at this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue tightened around $84.1 to $84.25 with my bid now at $84.30, still no trades occurred. Sellers hold asks mostly around $89.5 and above, with Maya's ask at $84.5 as a notable low outlier.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.35 to maintain a leading position and test seller willingness to reduce asks near $84.5. Observed bid queue remains clustered around $84.1-$84.3, and lowest ask stayed at $84.5 with other asks above $88.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of 84.40 to maintain lead and test seller response near the 84.5 ask. Bid queue remains tightly clustered just above 84.3, with lowest ask still at 84.5.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of 84.65, increasing slightly above previous bids to lead and test seller willingness to reduce their asks near 85.4. Bid queue remains clustered under 85 with lowest ask at 85.4 by Seller Esme.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $84.00 which is just above the current top bid of $83.63. The bid queue is concentrated in the 81-83 range while asks remain high in the 96-98 range.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.25, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.00, maintaining a leading position in the bid queue while no trades occurred at this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue tightened around $84.1 to $84.25 with my bid now at $84.30, still no trades occurred. Sellers hold asks mostly around $89.5 and above, with Maya's ask at $84.5 as a notable low outlier.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.35 to maintain a leading position and test seller willingness to reduce asks near $84.5. Observed bid queue remains clustered around $84.1-$84.3, and lowest ask stayed at $84.5 with other asks above $88.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of 84.40 to maintain lead and test seller response near the 84.5 ask. Bid queue remains tightly clustered just above 84.3, with lowest ask still at 84.5.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of 84.65, increasing slightly above previous bids to lead and test seller willingness to reduce their asks near 85.4. Bid queue remains clustered under 85 with lowest ask at 85.4 by Seller Esme.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $84.75, increasing my leading bid to further narrow the gap with the lowest ask of $85.4 while the bid queue remains clustered below 84.75 and sellers hold firm at 85.4 or above.
Hour 8: Placed a bid of $84.80 to maintain the lead and test seller response to a higher bid near the 85.25 ask level. Bid queue remains tightly clustered just below my bid with asks stable around 85.25 to 85.41.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 8: You bought from Seller Wei at $84.4





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered below my bid of 84.75; sellers hold firm asks around 85.25 to 85.41; trades occur below my bids indicating some sellers accept lower prices off-queue. #### Thoughts: Sellers' ask resistance persists, and some asks may be strategic or non-genuine; bid-ask spread remains about $0.45; maintaining lead is critical but must balance with trade likelihood. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to 84.80 to signal stronger willingness to transact and pressure sellers to lower asks closer to bids or trigger trades; monitor seller movement carefully; consider incremental raises or tactical withdrawal if no progress by next hour.

#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered below my bid; sellers' asks stable around $85.0-$85.4; last trade executed below my bid at $84.4 indicating some off-queue seller acceptances; bid-ask spread remains around $0.45. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue strong ask resistance; trades happen below my bids suggesting potential for negotiation; maintaining lead is crucial to influence market price; incremental bid increases effective but must balance margin preservation. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to $84.85 to signal stronger willingness to trade and pressure sellers; monitor sellers' ask movements and trade activity closely; prepare for incremental raises or possible bid withdrawal if no progress by next hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $84.00 which is just above the current top bid of $83.63. The bid queue is concentrated in the 81-83 range while asks remain high in the 96-98 range.
Hour 2: Placed a bid of $84.25, slightly above the previous highest bid of $84.00, maintaining a leading position in the bid queue while no trades occurred at this hour.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, the bid queue tightened around $84.1 to $84.25 with my bid now at $84.30, still no trades occurred. Sellers hold asks mostly around $89.5 and above, with Maya's ask at $84.5 as a notable low outlier.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.35 to maintain a leading position and test seller willingness to reduce asks near $84.5. Observed bid queue remains clustered around $84.1-$84.3, and lowest ask stayed at $84.5 with other asks above $88.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of 84.40 to maintain lead and test seller response near the 84.5 ask. Bid queue remains tightly clustered just above 84.3, with lowest ask still at 84.5.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of 84.65, increasing slightly above previous bids to lead and test seller willingness to reduce their asks near 85.4. Bid queue remains clustered under 85 with lowest ask at 85.4 by Seller Esme.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $84.75, increasing my leading bid to further narrow the gap with the lowest ask of $85.4 while the bid queue remains clustered below 84.75 and sellers hold firm at 85.4 or above.
Hour 8: Placed a bid of $84.80 to maintain the lead and test seller response to a higher bid near the 85.25 ask level. Bid queue remains tightly clustered just below my bid with asks stable around 85.25 to 85.41.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of $84.85 to maintain lead and pressure sellers; bid queue remains clustered below my bid; asks still hold around $85.0 to $85.4.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $84.90, slightly above the current highest bids clustered at $84.77 to $84.85, maintaining a leading position and further pressuring sellers with asks around $85.2 to $85.4.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered below $84.95; sellers hold firm asks around $85.17-$85.24; bid-ask spread steady at approx. $0.22-$0.30; no trade breakthroughs yet this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are resistant to lowering asks below $85.17 despite my incremental bid increases; maintaining the top bid is crucial to keep market influence; trades thus far occur below bids, indicating sellers accept offers below visible ask prices at times. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $84.95 to test seller flexibility; be prepared to increment bids further in small steps if no trade progress by Hour 12; consider bid withdrawal if sellers remain inflexible to preserve margin.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 4: Placed a bid of $84.35 to maintain a leading position and test seller willingness to reduce asks near $84.5. Observed bid queue remains clustered around $84.1-$84.3, and lowest ask stayed at $84.5 with other asks above $88.

Hour 8: Placed a bid of $84.80 to maintain the lead and test seller response to a higher bid near the 85.25 ask level. Bid queue remains tightly clustered just below my bid with asks stable around 85.25 to 85.41.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of $84.85 to maintain lead and pressure sellers; bid queue remains clustered below my bid; asks still hold around $85.0 to $85.4.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $84.90, slightly above the current highest bids clustered at $84.77 to $84.85, maintaining a leading position and further pressuring sellers with asks around $85.2 to $85.4.
Hour 11: Placed a bid of $84.95 maintaining top bid position; bid queue clustered below $84.95; sellers' lowest asks remain near $85.17-$85.24, no trades reported yet this hour.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $85.00 to maintain leadership and pressure sellers near their 85.17-85.24 ask range; bid queue remains clustered below my bid with no trades yet reported.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered below 85.00; sellers hold firm asks near 85.16-85.24; bid-ask spread steady at ~0.17-0.24; trades occur below bids, showing marginal seller concessions. #### Thoughts: Sellers are resistant to lowering asks below ~85.15; maintaining top bid influences market perception; marginal bid increments test sellers' flexibility without eroding margin significantly. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 85.00 this hour to maintain lead and pressure sellers; monitor for any trade breakthroughs; if no progress by Hour 14, consider a small bid raise or bid withdrawal to protect profits and optimize trade timing.

{

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered below 85.00; sellers maintain asks near 85.16-85.24; bid-ask spread steady; no new trades at 85.00 bid; previous successful trades at prices below current asks. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm; maintaining bid at 85.00 preserves margin and top position; incremental bid increases may risk margin with uncertain seller response; withdrawal risks losing market presence. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 85.00 this hour to continue pressuring sellers and maintain leadership; if no trades by Hour 15, consider slight bid increase or withdrawal to optimize final profitability and timing.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a bid of $85.00 over the last several hours preserved my top bid position but did not induce sellers to lower their asks or yield trades at that price. Successful trades historically occurred below $85.00, indicating sellers are reluctant to accept bids at or above their firm asks near $85.16-$85.24. Incremental bid increases could pressure sellers but risk reducing margins with uncertain trade likelihood.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Since this is the final hour, I will increase my bid slightly above $85.10 to $85.15 to try to trigger a trade by outbidding competitors and narrowing the spread with seller asks. This is a calculated risk to secure a trade before the market closes while keeping a reasonable margin below my true value of $100.00.",
  "bid": 85.15,
  "new_memory": "Placed a bid of $85.15 aiming to surpass competing bids and approach seller asks to facilitate a trade in the final hour.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue clustered below 85.10; sellers firmly hold asks around 85.15-85.24; previous bid of 85.00 maintained leadership but no trades triggered; final hour requires decisive action. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase above 85.10 may pressure sellers to accept or outbid rivals; risk balanced by proximity to true value and need to secure final trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.15 to lead bids and approach seller asks, maximizing chance of trade completion before market ends while preserving profitability."
