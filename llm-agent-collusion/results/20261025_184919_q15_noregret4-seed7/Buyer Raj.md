# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Bids cluster low-mid 80s; asks still high at mid-80s to mid-90s; early trades near $83-$84; my bid at $84.10 competitive but no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bidding just above highest bid improves queue position; sellers maintain high ask prices; trades likely to occur near or just above current bid levels but below asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above highest bid to $84.26 to enhance trade chances while preserving margin; continue monitoring spread and trade prices; be prepared to increment bids gradually but remain well below $100 true value; aim to initiate profitable trades early and adjust approach as market dynamics evolve toward Hour 15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread: my bid is 82.00, just above the highest existing bid of 81.31; lowest ask remains high at 96.41. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $84.10, just above the highest competitor bid of $84.00, aiming to improve my position in the bid queue and start securing profitable trades.
Hour 3: Hour 3 opened with bids clustered between $83.5 and $84.25, sellers' asks remain high with lowest at $84.5 and others above $88. I placed a bid at $84.26, just above the highest bid to improve queue position.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remains tightly clustered in the $84.1 to $84.5 range; asks are still high above $88. I placed a bid at $84.31, just above the highest bid of $84.30, maintaining a competitive position without overpaying.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered tightly in low to mid 80s; asks still above bids, mostly high 80s with lowest at $85. Recent trades occur around $83-$85, but none for me yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain queue position but have not yet induced trades. Sellers remain firm above $85. Need to balance margin preservation with securing trades. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids just above highest bid by small increments (~$0.01) to maintain queue priority. Watch if sellers reduce ask prices near $85 to capitalize by slightly increasing bids. Avoid large jumps to protect profitability. Prepare to adjust strategy if market tightens or trades become more frequent as hour 15 approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour 1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread: my bid is 82.00, just above the highest existing bid of 81.31; lowest ask remains high at 96.41. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $84.10, just above the highest competitor bid of $84.00, aiming to improve my position in the bid queue and start securing profitable trades.
Hour 3: Hour 3 opened with bids clustered between $83.5 and $84.25, sellers' asks remain high with lowest at $84.5 and others above $88. I placed a bid at $84.26, just above the highest bid to improve queue position.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remains tightly clustered in the $84.1 to $84.5 range; asks are still high above $88. I placed a bid at $84.31, just above the highest bid of $84.30, maintaining a competitive position without overpaying.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue remains tightly clustered around low 84s with the highest bid at $84.55. The lowest ask is still high at $85.0. I placed a bid at $84.36, just above the previous highest bid of $84.35 to maintain competitive position.
Hour 6: Hour 6 opened with bid queue tightly clustered from 84.25 to 84.6 and asks still significantly higher above 85. I placed a bid at 84.37, just above the previous highest bid of 84.36.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids clustered mid-84s; highest bid at 84.75; asks remain above 85.25; no trades secured by me yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases maintain queue position but fail to close spread; sellers firm; trades mostly below 85; risk of losing trading opportunities with overly conservative bids as deadline approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above last highest bid by one cent to 84.39 to improve trade chances; continue monitoring ask prices; be ready to accelerate bid increases if no trade occurs soon; balance margin preservation with urgency to secure trades before hour 15.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered mid-84s, highest bid 84.76; asks steady above 85.0 with no dip below 85. Lowest ask at 85.0, still too high to induce immediate trades. No successful trades for me yet.
#### Thoughts: Incremental 1-cent bid increases keep me competitive but have not closed the spread; sellers are firm; market indicates a gap between buyer willingness and seller price.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue small incremental bid increases just above highest bid to improve queue position and push toward closing spread. Aim bid at 84.77 this hour. Ready to accelerate bid increase pace if no trades occur soon to avoid missing trading opportunities as deadline approaches. Monitor ask prices closely for signs of softening.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered mid-84s with highest at 84.78; asks remain elevated above 85 with no trade execution for me. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases preserved queue status but failed to trigger seller price drops or trades. Sellers appear firm; bid-ask spread unchanged. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at 84.77 this hour to maintain position and test market response; prepare to raise bid more aggressively next hour to narrow spread and increase trade probability as Hour 15 deadline nears. Monitor ask movements closely for any signs of softening or new lower asks.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered in mid-84s, highest now 84.85; asks remain firm above 85, no trades secured for us yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases preserved queue but no impact on ask prices or executions; sellers remain steadfast. #### Updated Strategy: Slightly raise bid to 84.86 to maintain top queue position and signal stronger buying intent without sacrificing much margin; observe seller reactions closely. Prepare to escalate bids further if no response by Hour 14 as endgame approaches, balancing urgency with profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases have maintained a strong queue position but have not influenced the ask side or resulted in trades. Our bids remain below the lowest ask prices, indicating sellers' unwillingness to lower their asks or match current bid levels.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 14: You bought from Seller Tara at $85.08





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered in mid-84s to low 85; lowest asks steady at 85.15 and above; no trades for us yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases preserved position but didn't move market; sellers hold firm at 85+. Wide spread persists. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to 85.15 to match lowest ask, signaling higher willingness to trade and potentially trigger execution or seller adjustment. Prepare to escalate or accept marginally lower profit in final hour to secure trade and maximize overall profitability.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases over past hours maintained competitive position but failed to induce seller concessions or trigger trades except last hour where matching the ask led to a successful trade at 85.08. This indicates sellers hold firm near 85.15 and above, creating a persistent spread reducing trade frequency. Earlier reluctance to match ask prices delayed securing trades, risking no acquisition before market close.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, prioritize securing at least one trade by matching the lowest ask price to ensure acquisition, balancing profit and certainty. Since sellers are not lowering asks below 85.15, matching or slightly exceeding 85.15 maximizes trade probability without surpassing own valuation of 100. Avoid withdrawing bid to maintain market presence and signal readiness to transact.",
  "bid": 85.15,
  "new_memory": "At Hour 15, I placed a bid at 85.15, matching the lowest ask price again to maintain strong trade intent amid tightly clustered bids and firm asks.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids remain tightly clustered around 85.0 to 85.1; lowest asks steady at 85.15 and above; last hour's bid at 85.15 secured a trade at 85.08, indicating sellers' firmness near this level. #### Thoughts: Persistent spread and seller price rigidity have limited trade frequency; matching the ask price finally triggered a successful trade. #### Updated Strategy: In final hour, maintain bid at 85.15 to secure at least one more trade, balancing profit margin and certainty before market closes."
