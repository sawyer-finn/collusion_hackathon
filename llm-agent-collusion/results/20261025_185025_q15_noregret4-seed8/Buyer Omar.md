# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Aim to gradually close the spread and secure trades by Hour 10, avoiding bids above $100. Maintain balance between competitiveness and margin preservation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest current bid of $83.71, to improve competitiveness early in the market. No trades occurred yet; the spread remains wide with asks starting at $96.28.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains tight with many bids clustered around $83.7-$83.75, while asks remain high around $96+. I increased my bid to $85.00 to be more competitive.
Hour 3: Placed bid at $86.00, slightly above highest current bids, aiming to improve competitiveness and test sellers' willingness to lower asks.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remains crowded around $83.75-$85.25 with no trades yet; sellers' asks remain high starting at $87.99. I placed a bid at $86.50 to lead bids and probe seller resistance.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest current bid of $83.71, to improve competitiveness early in the market. No trades occurred yet; the spread remains wide with asks starting at $96.28.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains tight with many bids clustered around $83.7-$83.75, while asks remain high around $96+. I increased my bid to $85.00 to be more competitive.
Hour 3: Placed bid at $86.00, slightly above highest current bids, aiming to improve competitiveness and test sellers' willingness to lower asks.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remains crowded around $83.75-$85.25 with no trades yet; sellers' asks remain high starting at $87.99. I placed a bid at $86.50 to lead bids and probe seller resistance.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at $85.60, slightly above the highest current bid of $85.3 to test seller reaction and improve competitiveness. The bid queue remains tightly clustered below $85.3, and sellers maintain asks above $87.99.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I maintained my bid at $85.6, holding near the top of the bid queue. The ask prices stayed above $87.5 with no trades triggered; the spread remains wide.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Theo at $82.5
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Raj at $83.25
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Theo at $83.5





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered just under $85.75; sellers maintain firm asks above $87.5, keeping the spread wide. No trade triggered by bids near $85.6. #### Thoughts: Previous bid increases have not pressured sellers to lower asks; maintaining margin is critical given current spread. Holding position near top bid tests sellers without overshooting value. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.6 this hour to maintain competitiveness, observe seller behavior. If asks remain firm, consider moderate incremental bid increase next hour but remain well below $100 true value to ensure profitability while closing spread gradually.


# Output Format

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered just under $85.85; sellers maintain asks above $87; no trades triggered at $85.6 bids; spread remains wide and unchanged. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not pressured sellers to lower asks; maintaining margin is critical given wide spread; holding near top bid tests sellers without overshooting value. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.6 this hour to maintain competitiveness and observe seller response; if asks remain firm next hour, consider a moderate incremental bid increase closer to $86.0 but remain well below $100 true value to gradually close spread while preserving profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.72, just above the highest current bid of $83.71, to improve competitiveness early in the market. No trades occurred yet; the spread remains wide with asks starting at $96.28.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue remains tight with many bids clustered around $83.7-$83.75, while asks remain high around $96+. I increased my bid to $85.00 to be more competitive.
Hour 3: Placed bid at $86.00, slightly above highest current bids, aiming to improve competitiveness and test sellers' willingness to lower asks.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remains crowded around $83.75-$85.25 with no trades yet; sellers' asks remain high starting at $87.99. I placed a bid at $86.50 to lead bids and probe seller resistance.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at $85.60, slightly above the highest current bid of $85.3 to test seller reaction and improve competitiveness. The bid queue remains tightly clustered below $85.3, and sellers maintain asks above $87.99.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I maintained my bid at $85.6, holding near the top of the bid queue. The ask prices stayed above $87.5 with no trades triggered; the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I maintained my bid at $85.6, remaining near the top of the bid queue. Seller asks stayed firm above $86, keeping the spread wide and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remained tightly clustered with my bid steady at $85.6, retaining a position near the top bids. Seller asks stayed firm above $87, and no trades were triggered this hour.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid queue remains dense around $85.8-$85.9 with my bid increased to $85.9 to match top bids. Seller asks remain firm above $87, maintaining a wide spread and no trades triggered.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid at $85.9, matching the top bids in a tightly clustered bid queue. Seller asks remained firm above $86, and no trades were triggered this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Theo at $82.5

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered near $85.85-$85.9; sellers holding firm asks above $87; no trades despite matching highest bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance; incremental bid increases below $86 have not pressured sellers; maintaining margin is critical; matching top bids signals strong interest but hasn't moved sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.9 to test seller resolve; preserve margin; monitor seller reaction closely; if no ask adjustments by next hour, consider moderate increase close to $86 to narrow spread.

#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered near $85.85-$85.9; sellers maintaining asks firmly above $87; no trades despite matching highest bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance; incremental bid increases below $86 have not pressured sellers; maintaining margin is critical; matching top bids signals strong interest but hasn't moved sellers. Slightly exceeding $86 may test seller patience. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.01 to probe seller price flexibility and attempt to narrow spread; preserve profitability; if sellers remain firm, prepare to adjust strategy after observing market reaction.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 4: In Hour 4, the bid queue remains crowded around $83.75-$85.25 with no trades yet; sellers' asks remain high starting at $87.99. I placed a bid at $86.50 to lead bids and probe seller resistance.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid at $85.60, slightly above the highest current bid of $85.3 to test seller reaction and improve competitiveness. The bid queue remains tightly clustered below $85.3, and sellers maintain asks above $87.99.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I maintained my bid at $85.6, holding near the top of the bid queue. The ask prices stayed above $87.5 with no trades triggered; the spread remains wide.

Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid queue remains dense around $85.8-$85.9 with my bid increased to $85.9 to match top bids. Seller asks remain firm above $87, maintaining a wide spread and no trades triggered.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid at $85.9, matching the top bids in a tightly clustered bid queue. Seller asks remained firm above $86, and no trades were triggered this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered near $85.9-$86.05; sellers maintain asks firmly above $86.69, preserving a wide spread and no trades triggered despite top bids rising. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance; incremental increases below $86.1 have not moved sellers; matching top bids signals interest but no pressure on sellers; slight increase above $86.01 to $86.10 is a strategic test of seller willingness. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.10 to probe seller price flexibility and attempt to narrow spread; preserve profitability; if sellers remain firm, prepare to reassess strategy after observing market reaction in subsequent hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Theo at $82.5
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Raj at $83.25
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Theo at $83.5





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered near $85.9-$86.15; seller asks persist above $86.59, maintaining a wide spread and no trades. Incremental bid increases have not induced seller concessions or trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance; maintaining $86.10 keeps me competitive without eroding profit margin; signaling steady buying interest but no urgency yet. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $86.10 this hour to test sellers further; if no trade occurs by Hour 14, reassess with a potential bid increase to apply time pressure and balance profitability with securing trades before market close.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nova Shipbuilding as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Theo at $82.5
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Raj at $83.25

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between $85.95 and $86.3; seller asks persist above $86.49, no trades triggered. Incremental bid increases have not moved seller ask prices or triggered trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain resistant to lowering asks; maintaining $86.10 keeps me competitive while preserving profit margin; signaling steady demand without inducing price erosion. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $86.10 this hour to maintain pressure; if no trade occurs by Hour 15, increase bid to a level closer to true value ($100) to secure at least one trade before market closes, balancing urgency and profitability.
