Spread remains wide but showing signs of tightening. #### Thoughts: Sellers are gradually lowering asks but still above bids; buyers hesitant to bid aggressively but competition is increasing. Incremental bid increases may pressure sellers to lower asks further or trigger trades. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $84.15 to improve queue position and readiness to trade; monitor if asks dip closer to bids to push bids more aggressively; preserve margin while preparing to accelerate bid increases if no trades occur soon.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Femi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide spread between bids (max $83.71 by Buyer Omar) and asks (min $96.28 by Seller Sami). My bid was $83.31, slightly below the top bid. I increased my bid to $83.80 to improve position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 observed no narrowing of the spread; lowest ask remains $86.5 and my bid at $83.80 remains the highest bid in the queue.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows a tight cluster between $83.25 and $86.25 with my bid now increased to $84.15, maintaining a competitive position. The lowest ask remains high at $86.5, and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains clustered with top bids around $86.4, and lowest asks are still above $86.4 but sellers have not lowered prices significantly. I increased my bid to $85.95 to improve competitiveness.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue is tightly clustered near $84.0 to $86.4 with several buyers bidding around $86.3-$86.4; lowest asks remain just above $86.4; recent trades occurred between $84.25 and $86.5, showing upward price movement. #### Thoughts: Slightly increasing bid above $85.95 is necessary to stay competitive and improve chances of trades; sellers have not lowered asks significantly below $86.4; balancing aggressive bidding with profit margin preservation is critical. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.10 to better compete with top buyers while maintaining a reasonable margin; monitor subsequent spread narrowing and seller ask adjustments to decide further bid increments or withdrawal.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Femi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide spread between bids (max $83.71 by Buyer Omar) and asks (min $96.28 by Seller Sami). My bid was $83.31, slightly below the top bid. I increased my bid to $83.80 to improve position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 observed no narrowing of the spread; lowest ask remains $86.5 and my bid at $83.80 remains the highest bid in the queue.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows a tight cluster between $83.25 and $86.25 with my bid now increased to $84.15, maintaining a competitive position. The lowest ask remains high at $86.5, and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains clustered with top bids around $86.4, and lowest asks are still above $86.4 but sellers have not lowered prices significantly. I increased my bid to $85.95 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows a cluster at the $84.0-$86.4 range with several buyers at $86.3 and $86.4. The lowest asks remain high at $86.43-$86.45 and above. I increased my bid to $86.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows bid queue tightly clustered around $84.25 to $86.4 with top bids near $86.3-$86.4. Lowest asks remain just above $86.4 with no significant drop. I increased my bid to $86.42 to improve position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered near $84.25 to $86.4; top bids at $86.3-$86.4; lowest asks still just above $86.4; no major ask price drops; recent trades around $84.25-$86.5 show upward price trend. #### Thoughts: Need to outbid top cluster buyers slightly to gain priority and improve trade likelihood; sellers hold firm on ask prices; balancing bid to not exceed lowest ask preserves margin but keeps competitiveness; watch for ask price drops or trade executions as signals. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally above top bids but below lowest ask to maintain margin and prioritize my bid; set bid at $86.42 this hour; observe market reactions closely for next moves.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Femi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide spread between bids (max $83.71 by Buyer Omar) and asks (min $96.28 by Seller Sami). My bid was $83.31, slightly below the top bid. I increased my bid to $83.80 to improve position.
Hour 2: Hour #2 observed no narrowing of the spread; lowest ask remains $86.5 and my bid at $83.80 remains the highest bid in the queue.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue shows a tight cluster between $83.25 and $86.25 with my bid now increased to $84.15, maintaining a competitive position. The lowest ask remains high at $86.5, and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue remains clustered with top bids around $86.4, and lowest asks are still above $86.4 but sellers have not lowered prices significantly. I increased my bid to $85.95 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue shows a cluster at the $84.0-$86.4 range with several buyers at $86.3 and $86.4. The lowest asks remain high at $86.43-$86.45 and above. I increased my bid to $86.10 to improve competitiveness.
Hour 6: Hour 6 shows bid queue tightly clustered around $84.25 to $86.4 with top bids near $86.3-$86.4. Lowest asks remain just above $86.4 with no significant drop. I increased my bid to $86.42 to improve position.
Hour 7: Hour 7 shows bid queue clustered between $85.2 and $86.4 with top bids at $86.4; lowest asks are still high around $96.15 to $97.49; I placed a bid at $86.43 to maintain a competitive position.
Hour 8: Hour 8 sees bid queue clustered between $85.5 and $86.45, with my bid at $86.44 slightly above top bids. Asks remain very high around $96.14 to $97.49, no trades occurred near my bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between $85.5 and $86.45; my bid at $86.44 is just above the top bids. Ask prices persistently high around $96+, far above bids. No trades near current bid prices. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid slightly above competitors preserves queue priority and readiness to trade when asks drop. Sellers have not yet responded to bid pressure, so aggressive bidding is not justified to avoid margin erosion. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid marginally above top bids (currently $86.4-$86.43) to stay competitive without overpaying. Closely monitor for any reduction in ask prices or trades near my bid before considering a higher bid.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

{

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered between $85.75 and $86.45; my bid now $86.46 just above top bids. Lowest asks persist above $96, far from current bids. No trades near bids except my prior purchase at $86.41. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a marginally higher bid secures queue position without sacrificing profit margin. Sellers have not responded to bid pressure by lowering asks. Aggressive bidding unnecessary now; patience needed. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids just above highest competitors to ensure top position and readiness to trade if asks decline. Monitor for any ask price drops or trades near bids before increasing bid further.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Femi. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered $85.75-$86.47, my bid now $86.48 marginally above top bids. Asks still above $96, no trades around bids. Sellers have not lowered asks despite bid pressure. #### Thoughts: Small incremental bid increases maintain top queue position without compromising profit margin. Sellers remain firm on ask prices, indicating no immediate market tightening. #### Updated Strategy: Continue outbidding top bids by a cent to keep competitive edge; avoid large jumps in bid price to protect margin. Remain patient and watch for any ask price decreases or narrowing of spread before considering aggressive bids.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered between $85.75 and $86.49, I maintain highest bid by a cent; asks remain high above $96 with no signs of sellers lowering prices. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm despite bid pressure, indicating strong ask-side market power or reluctance to trade at current bid levels. Incremental bid increases have preserved margin but no trades means no volume secured. #### Updated Strategy: Continue minimal incremental bid increases to hold highest bid position without sacrificing margin. Closely watch ask prices for any decreases. If asks remain high by Hour 13, consider withdrawing bid to avoid exposure and wait for better trading conditions or last-hour aggressive bidding.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered around $85.75 to $86.50 with me holding the highest bid at $86.50; sellers' asks persist above $96, showing no sign of relaxation. #### Thoughts: Sellers show strong market power or reluctance to trade at current bid levels, making volume acquisition difficult despite aggressive bidding; continuing incremental bid increases risks diminishing returns without trades. #### Updated Strategy: Place minimal increment bid increase to maintain highest position for now; closely monitor ask behavior; if asks remain rigid by Hour 14, withdraw bid to avoid overexposure and wait for potential last-hour market shifts.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

# Market Rules

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Tara at $86.41
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Ana at $86.42





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered around $85.75 to $86.51 with me holding the highest bid at $86.51; sellers' asks persist above $96, showing no sign of relaxation. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to exert strong market power with asks well above bids, resulting in no trades despite aggressive bidding; further bid increments risk reduced profit margins with low likelihood of successful trades. #### Updated Strategy: Place minimal bid increment to stay highest bidder this hour; if asks remain unchanged by Hour 15, consider withdrawing bid to avoid losses and await possible last-hour shifts or market exhaustion.

{
  "reflection": "Despite consistently placing the highest bids around $86.50-$86.51, trades only occurred when sellers lowered their ask prices closer to the bid range, which only happened sporadically and briefly. Sellers have maintained ask prices above $96 for many hours, resulting in no trade execution at my bid levels. Incremental bid increases have not yielded trades but have reduced potential profit margins slightly.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and sellers remain far above our true value, I will place a minimal increment bid of $86.52 to maintain the highest bid position, aiming to secure a trade if any seller drops significantly, while preserving as much profit margin as possible. If no trade occurs, I will withdraw bids in future scenarios to avoid losses, but since this is final hour, holding a competitive bid is preferable.",
  "bid": 86.52,
  "new_memory": "Hour 15 opened with bid queue clustered just below and at $86.5; I placed a bid at $86.52 maintaining highest bid position. Asks remain firm above $96 with no trades occurring near bids.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered around $85.75 to $86.52 with me holding the highest bid at $86.52; asks persist firmly above $96, no trades at current bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to dominate with high asks; incremental bid increases have not triggered trades. Final hour urgency makes maintaining highest bid necessary for any chance of trade. #### Updated Strategy: Place minimal increment bid $86.52 to stay highest this final hour; avoid overbidding beyond this as it risks profit margin with minimal likelihood of trade; if asks remain unchanged, no trades expected this hour."
