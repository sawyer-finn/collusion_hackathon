## Past Trades

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Market opened with bids clustered between 81.61 and 83.66.
- Asks are significantly higher, between 96.45 and 98.55, indicating a wide spread.
- No trades yet; market is illiquid or cautious.

#### Thoughts
- Early bids are conservative; sellers have not yet lowered ask prices.
- Our bid at 81.66 was not competitive enough to lead; must outbid top buyer to gain priority.
- The large spread means opportunity for profit but requires patience and strategic bid adjustments.

#### Updated Strategy
- Incrementally increase bid prices to lead bids but remain below true value (100.0).
- Monitor ask price movements closely to time bids that can match asks for trades with good margins.
- Prepare to reduce bid if ask prices remain high or withdraw if better opportunities arise later.
- Use bid increments to test market willingness and respond accordingly in subsequent hours.

#### Observations: Bids cluster narrowly around 83.8 to 84.1; sellers maintain ask prices above 96.38 with no downward movement; no trades executed this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers are patient and firm on ask prices; my incremental bid increases keep me competitive but are not triggering trades; market spread remains wide. #### Updated Strategy: Continue leading bid queue with modest increments just above highest bid to test seller patience without sacrificing margin; be patient and watch ask price trends; remain ready to withdraw or lower bids if sellers stay firm for too long; aim for trades closer to 96 or below to ensure good profits.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a competitive initial bid of 83.67 slightly above the highest current bid (83.66) to improve chances of being at the front of the bid queue. No trades executed yet.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid of 84.01, just above the highest bid of 84.0, to lead the bid queue and test seller willingness to lower ask prices.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 84.06, just above the current highest bid, maintaining queue leadership but no trades executed as sellers hold ask prices steady around 96.38 and above.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of 84.20, slightly above the current highest competing bids of 84.15. Sellers continued to hold asks mostly around 96.38 and above, with no trades executed this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks around 96.3+, no trade despite bid increases; bids cluster below 85; market spread still wide (~12 dollars).
#### Thoughts: Sellers show strong resistance to lowering ask prices; buyers reluctant to bridge spread; increasing bid marginally tests seller patience without risking overpayment.

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm with asks clustered around 96.3+; buyers are bidding up to 85.0; no trades involving my bids so far; market spread remains large (~11+ dollars).
#### Thoughts: Sellers show no inclination to lower asks despite bid increases; competing buyers are cautious not to overpay; my marginal bid increases maintain leadership but do not trigger trades.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid leadership with minimal increments above highest competing bid to conserve profit margin; monitor ask prices closely for any downward movement; prepare to withdraw bid if no ask reduction or trades occur soon to avoid losses; patience and timing critical to balance trade execution and profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain above 95.87; bid queue topped just below 85.1; no trades involving my bids; spread remains large (~11+ dollars).
#### Thoughts: Small bid increments do not pressure sellers to reduce asks; maintaining leadership keeps options open but no sign of narrowing spread.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue minimal bid increases to retain best bid position; preserve profit margin; watch for ask price drops or trade events; prepare to withdraw bid if no progress in coming hours to avoid forced unprofitable trades; exercise patience and prioritize securing profitable deals over volume.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain above 95.85; bid queue tops just above 85; no trades involving my bids; spread remains wide at ~11+ dollars. #### Thoughts: Minimal increments maintain leadership but have not moved ask prices or resulted in trades; other buyers bidding higher cap our bid position; risk of no trades persists. #### Updated Strategy: Continue minimal bid increments to hold best bid position and observe market; consider increasing increments if no progress by hour 12; monitor seller behavior for any ask price changes or trade opportunities; remain patient to avoid unprofitable trades but prepared to adjust strategy if market remains stagnant.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a competitive initial bid of 83.67 slightly above the highest current bid (83.66) to improve chances of being at the front of the bid queue. No trades executed yet.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid of 84.01, just above the highest bid of 84.0, to lead the bid queue and test seller willingness to lower ask prices.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 84.06, just above the current highest bid, maintaining queue leadership but no trades executed as sellers hold ask prices steady around 96.38 and above.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of 84.20, slightly above the current highest competing bids of 84.15. Sellers continued to hold asks mostly around 96.38 and above, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of 84.76, just above the current highest competing bid of 84.75. Sellers continued to hold ask prices around 96.34 and above with no trades executed.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of 84.77 slightly above previous 84.76 to maintain queue leadership; sellers continued to hold asks above 95.89 with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of 84.78, slightly above the highest competing bid of 84.77 to maintain queue leadership. Sellers still hold firm asks above 95.88 with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a bid of 84.79 to maintain queue leadership with a minimal increment. No trades executed and sellers' asks remain firm above 95.87.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of 84.80, slightly above the previous highest bid of 84.79, maintaining leadership in the bid queue. No trades executed this hour; sellers' asks remain firm above 95.86.
Hour 10: Placed a bid of 84.81, just above the highest bid of 84.80, maintaining queue leadership. Sellers' asks remain firm above 95.85 with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 11: Placed a bid of 84.82 to maintain lead by a minimal increment. Sellers continue to hold asks above 95.84, and no trades involving my bid occurred this hour.
Hour 12: Placed a bid of 85.16, increasing more than minimal increments to improve competitiveness amid a wide bid-ask spread and stagnant seller prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain above 95.83, bids peak around 85.75 but I am behind top bids. No trades occurred with my bids despite leading previously. The spread remains wide and static. #### Thoughts: Minimal increments have not yielded trades or seller concessions. Larger increments may pressure sellers to adjust asks or prompt trades. Risk of eroding profit margins if bids approach asks too quickly. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid by a more noticeable increment to improve competitiveness while staying below 86.00 to preserve margin. Continue to monitor seller ask dynamics and be ready to adjust if sellers lower asks or trade activity increases. Avoid sudden large jumps to maintain profitability. Maintain awareness of time horizon approaching final hours.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #13. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "Previous minimal bid increments maintained queue leadership but failed to yield trades or pressure sellers to lower ask prices, indicating sellers are firm near 96.3.

Must balance competitiveness against profit margin erosion. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.85 to approach top bids without exceeding 86.0, maintaining margin. Monitor market reaction closely for any shift in ask prices or trade activity. Prepare to escalate more aggressively if approaching final hour without trades."

Must balance competitiveness against profit margin erosion. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.85 to approach top bids without exceeding 86.0, maintaining margin. Monitor market reaction closely for any shift in ask prices or trade activity. Prepare to escalate more aggressively if approaching final hour without trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Juno. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a competitive initial bid of 83.67 slightly above the highest current bid (83.66) to improve chances of being at the front of the bid queue. No trades executed yet.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid of 84.01, just above the highest bid of 84.0, to lead the bid queue and test seller willingness to lower ask prices.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of 84.06, just above the current highest bid, maintaining queue leadership but no trades executed as sellers hold ask prices steady around 96.38 and above.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of 84.20, slightly above the current highest competing bids of 84.15. Sellers continued to hold asks mostly around 96.38 and above, with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 5: Placed a bid of 84.76, just above the current highest competing bid of 84.75. Sellers continued to hold ask prices around 96.34 and above with no trades executed.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of 84.77 slightly above previous 84.76 to maintain queue leadership; sellers continued to hold asks above 95.89 with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 7: Placed a bid of 84.78, slightly above the highest competing bid of 84.77 to maintain queue leadership. Sellers still hold firm asks above 95.88 with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a bid of 84.79 to maintain queue leadership with a minimal increment. No trades executed and sellers' asks remain firm above 95.87.
Hour 9: Placed a bid of 84.80, slightly above the previous highest bid of 84.79, maintaining leadership in the bid queue. No trades executed this hour; sellers' asks remain firm above 95.86.
Hour 10: Placed a bid of 84.81, just above the highest bid of 84.80, maintaining queue leadership. Sellers' asks remain firm above 95.85 with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 11: Placed a bid of 84.82 to maintain lead by a minimal increment. Sellers continue to hold asks above 95.84, and no trades involving my bid occurred this hour.
Hour 12: Placed a bid of 85.16, increasing more than minimal increments to improve competitiveness amid a wide bid-ask spread and stagnant seller prices.
Hour 13: Placed a bid of 85.85, climbing closer to top bids but still below highest bids at 85.75 and 86.0. Sellers continue to hold firm asks around 95.81 to 96.31 with no trades involving my bid this hour.
Hour 14: Placed a bid of 85.85 to maintain a competitive position just below highest bids at 86.0. No trades executed this hour; sellers' asks remain firm above 95.78.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks persist around 95.78-96.31; no trades involving my bids; top bids slightly above mine at 86.0; bid-ask spread still wide and stable. #### Thoughts: Minimal bid increments insufficient to break sellers' price hold; moderate increments maintain competitiveness and queue position but no trade success yet; sellers are reluctant to reduce ask prices. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 85.85 to test seller reaction; prepare to increase bid aggressively in final hour if no trade occurs; balance profitability and trade certainty as time horizon narrows.
