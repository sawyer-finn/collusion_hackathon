# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 market opened with bids ranging from $81.61 to $83.66 and asks from $96.45 to $98.55. I placed a bid at $83.99, slightly above the highest existing bid to increase competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids range from $82.5 to $84.0, asks remain high between $96.4 and $98.44, and I placed a bid at $84.10 to enhance competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids are clustered around $84.1 with multiple buyers at this price, and asks remain high with the lowest at $85.0 from Seller Ilan. I placed a bid at $84.15 to just outbid competitors.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids are tightly clustered with highest at $84.6 and asks remain high starting at $92.49, significantly above bids. I placed a bid at $84.65 to marginally outbid competition.

Hour 1: Hour #1 market opened with bids ranging from $81.61 to $83.66 and asks from $96.45 to $98.55. I placed a bid at $83.99, slightly above the highest existing bid to increase competitiveness.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, bids range from $82.5 to $84.0, asks remain high between $96.4 and $98.44, and I placed a bid at $84.10 to enhance competitiveness.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids are clustered around $84.1 with multiple buyers at this price, and asks remain high with the lowest at $85.0 from Seller Ilan. I placed a bid at $84.15 to just outbid competitors.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids are tightly clustered with highest at $84.6 and asks remain high starting at $92.49, significantly above bids. I placed a bid at $84.65 to marginally outbid competition.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, bids remain tightly clustered around $84.6 to $84.75, with my bid at $84.65. Seller ask prices are unchanged and still high above $95. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, bids remain tightly packed with highest at $85.0 by Buyer Zoe; asks still high starting at $95.89. I placed a bid at $84.70 to remain competitive just below top bids.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly packed with highest bids at $85.0; asks persistently high from $95.89 and above; no trades made so far despite active bidding. #### Thoughts: Sellers are firm at high ask prices, buyers cluster bids just below $85. Opportunity to maintain margin while staying competitive by bidding just below top buyers. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid marginally to $84.70 to outbid most competitors except the very top, preserving margin and queue priority. Continue monitoring ask prices for any decline. If sellers show no concession, start preparing to incrementally increase bids more aggressively in later hours to secure trades before deadline.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains dense near $85.0-$85.1; asks persistently high above $95.8; no trades yet; sellers show no sign of lowering ask prices. #### Thoughts: The market is stable but buyers' bids are clustered just below top bids; sellers are not yielding yet, indicating strong pricing power or patience. Incremental bid increases are needed to test sellers' resolve without sacrificing margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $84.85 to maintain queue position and probe for seller response; avoid large jumps to preserve profitability; watch for any signs of ask price drops or trades; be ready to increase bid further if market conditions remain unchanged as deadline approaches.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains dense near $85.11-$85.15; top bids recently near $85.15; ask prices stubbornly high above $95.85; no trades triggered; strong seller price firmness. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases maintain competitiveness but have not yet induced ask price drops or trades; sellers show strong patience and pricing power; market stable but illiquid at current bid/ask spread. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid more noticeably this hour to $85.20 to outbid the top bids near $85.15 and test seller resolve more directly; avoid large jumps to preserve margin; watch for any ask price movements or trades; prepare to escalate bids further as time horizon shortens and final hours approach.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids stable at $85.5-$85.75; asks persist above $95.8 with no trades; sellers remain patient with high asks. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases ineffective at inducing trades or ask price drops; sellers retain pricing power; risk of no trades by market close rising. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.5 this hour to maintain competitiveness; prepare to raise bids more aggressively in remaining hours to force trades before market ends; monitor ask price movements closely to identify any signs of seller flexibility.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #13. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids stable at $85.5-$86.0; asks persist above $95.8 with no trades; sellers remain patient with high asks. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases ineffective at inducing trades or ask price drops; sellers retain pricing power; risk of no trades by market close rising. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.5 this hour to maintain competitiveness; prepare to raise bids more aggressively in remaining hours to force trades before market ends; monitor ask price movements closely to identify any seller flexibility or potential to strategically withdraw bid if market conditions worsen.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lena. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top bids stable around $85.5-$86.0; ask prices remain high above $95.7; no trades occurring despite competitive bids. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain strong pricing power; incremental bid increases have not induced trades or ask price drops; risk of no trades by market close is increasing. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.5 this hour to keep competitiveness and avoid bid inflation; prepare to raise bids more aggressively in the final hour to attempt forcing trades; monitor ask price movements for any signs of seller flexibility; consider strategic withdrawal only if market conditions worsen unexpectedly.
