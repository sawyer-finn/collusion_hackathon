# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00 in Hour #1, positioning slightly above the highest bid of $83.73 to increase competitiveness. Observed bids clustered below $84 and asks clustered near $96 and above.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $84.00 again in Hour #2, observing that the highest bids remain around $84.00 while sellers' asks continue to be high starting at $91.00 and above.
Hour 3: Hour #3: Bid maintained at $84.00. Highest bids remain clustered around $84.00 to $85.10. Asks still high, starting at $88.50 and mostly above $90. No trades involving our bid yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, bids remain clustered around $84.0 to $87.0 with sellers' asks now ranging from $88.4 to above $99. I placed a bid at $85.25 to become more competitive and test market response.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster is around $85.2 to $86.1; sellers' asks have not significantly dropped, still starting above $88.1; no trades with our bid yet; bid-ask spread remains wide. #### Thoughts: Our incremental increases have improved competitiveness but have not closed trades; sellers are firm on asks; buyers' bids indicate willingness to pay near $86.0. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.75 to get closer to sellers' ask range and test market response; avoid drastic bid jumps to preserve profit margin; monitor sellers' ask movements closely to adjust bid dynamically in subsequent hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains $85.2 to $86.3; asks hold steady near $87.95 to above $98; no trades with my bid; successful trades continue around $85.25 to $88.12 for others. #### Thoughts: My current bid holds competitiveness but is still below sellers' lowest asks; sellers remain firm, maintaining a wide bid-ask spread. Incremental bid increases have not closed the gap. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.75 to preserve margin and monitor for any downward movement in asks; prepare to incrementally increase bids in coming hours if asks drop closer to $86.0; focus on balancing profitability with trade closure as deadline approaches.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster is $85.21 to $87.5; seller asks remain stubbornly high at $87.91 and above; no trades involving us yet. Other buyers have also incrementally moved bids higher, with some bids now near $87.5. #### Thoughts: Our previous bid at $86.0 was competitive but insufficient to trigger trades. Sellers are holding firm with asks near $88. To improve trade chances, we need to close the gap by increasing our bid slightly, balancing profit margins against urgency to trade as time shortens. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.3 to better compete within the top bids, signaling willingness to trade closer to sellers' ask range. Monitor if sellers reduce asks or if trades occur; be prepared to further increase bids in subsequent hours while protecting margin as deadline approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains roughly $85.4 to $87.85; sellers' asks consistently above $87.87; no trades involving our bid. Other buyers have recently bid up to $87.85. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not triggered trades; sellers holding firm on high asks; competing at $86.50 positions us near top bids but below seller asks. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.50 this hour to test market response and preserve margin; monitor if sellers lower asks or market trades occur; prepare to increase bid closer to $87.0 or beyond in upcoming hours to secure trades before market closes.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster tight between $86.0 and $87.5; sellers' asks persist above $87.85; no trades with our bid at $86.5; other buyers are bidding up to $87.5. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain strong above $87.85, buyers hesitant to bid above $87; incremental bid increases below $87 not triggering trades; need to test higher bids closer to ask prices. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid this hour to $86.85 to gain edge in bid queue and test seller reaction; prepare to move bid closer to $87 or slightly above in next hour if no trades occur to secure deals before market closes; balance urgency with profit margin preservation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Esme. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Spectrum Devices as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 12: In Hour #12, the bid cluster remained between $85.4 and $87.85 with sellers' asks still high starting at $87.87. I placed a bid at $86.50, matching the higher end of buyers' bids but no trades occurred with our bid.
Hour 13: Placed bid at $86.85 in Hour #13 to gain slight edge over $86.50 bids; observed bid cluster remains tight below $87 and sellers' asks persist above $87.85 with no trades on our bid yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid to $87.90, positioning above the highest bids near $87.85 and close to the lowest seller asks around $87.95. The bid cluster tightened at the top end with no immediate trades on my bid yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 14: You bought from Seller Sami at $87.82





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster currently at $86.3 to $87.85, sellers' asks remain high at $87.95 to $88.25, no trades on my previous $86.85 bid. Other buyers bidding up to $87.85, sellers not lowering asks significantly. #### Thoughts: Previous bids below $87 have failed to secure trades; sellers’ ask prices are a critical barrier. Increasing bid above $87.85 may pressure sellers or lead to trade. Need to balance bid increase with profit margin as market is near closing. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $87.90 to surpass highest competing buyer bids and approach lowest seller asks to improve chances of trade before hour 15. Monitor reactions closely and prepare to adjust bid in final hour to maximize profitability with trade secured.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, gradually increasing my bid closer to the sellers' asks helped secure a trade at $87.82 in Hour 14, showing that being slightly aggressive near the end of the market horizon can succeed.

A balance between bidding high enough to transact and maintaining profitability is crucial, especially as the market closes.",
