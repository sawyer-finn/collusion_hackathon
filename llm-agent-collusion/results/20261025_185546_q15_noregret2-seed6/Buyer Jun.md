# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Entered Hour #1 with bids ranging from $81.39 to $83.73 and asks from $96.35 upward. Placed a bid at $83.80, making it the highest bid in the market currently.
Hour 2: Hour #2 shows bids clustered between $83.0 and $85.0 with the highest bid at $85.0 by Buyer Lia. Asks remain high from $91.0 to $98.3, with no trades yet. I placed a bid at $83.90, slightly higher than my previous $83.80.
Hour 3: Hour #3 shows a slightly more competitive bid queue topping at $85.10; lowest ask remains at $88.5, with no trades. I placed a bid at $84.10, raising my position among buyers.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bid queue shows bids mostly between $84.0 and $87.0, with my bid at $84.1 previously. Asks remain above $88.4, keeping the spread wide. I placed a bid at $84.30 to improve position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain competitive with top bids around 85.4 to 86.1; asks continue to hold above 88.1, preventing trades. No successful executions this hour despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers are not yet willing to drop asks near our bid range, maintaining a wide spread. Incremental bid raises keep us competitive but have not closed the gap. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to $85.40 to maintain top buyer status without excessive margin sacrifice; remain patient for ask price reduction near our bid; prepare to increase bid more aggressively if asks fall closer to 85 to secure trades before the final hours.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster steady between 85.4 and 86.35; asks slightly decreased but still above 87.95, no trades for us yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers have not responded to top bids; spread remains wide. Incremental bid increases have not closed the gap. Patience is key, but we must be ready to adjust if asks drop. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $85.40 to keep top buyer position without margin erosion. If asks drop below 87, consider raising bid moderately to secure trades before market closes.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster stable between 85.21 and 87.5; asks remain firm above 87.9, no trades for us yet. Sellers not responding to bids below $87. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases haven't closed the spread or triggered trades; maintaining position without margin loss is prudent. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $85.40 to preserve strong position; watch for asks dropping below $87, then raise bid moderately to around $86.00 to capture trades before market end.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue stable between $85.4 and $87.85; asks stubbornly above $87.8, with recent trades occurring at or above $86.0 by other buyers. My previous bid at $85.4 was not enough to trigger trades. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases are necessary to remain competitive and capture trades before end of market. Sellers are unlikely to reduce asks significantly soon. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.00 to better compete, balancing profitability and trade likelihood. Monitor asks closely; if asks dip below $87, consider further increments. Prepare to be more aggressive approaching Hour #15 to secure trades while maintaining margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now range from $86.0 to $87.5+; asks stubbornly above $87.8; previous bid $86.0 did not trigger trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers hold firm on ask prices, while buyers are increasing bids to compete. Incremental bid increases below $87 may attract trades without sacrificing too much margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.75 to better compete and pressure sellers. Monitor for any drop in asks. Prepare to bid closer to $87 or above in Hour #14 if no trades occur to secure trades before market close.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids have increased to nearly $87.85; asks remain firm above $87.8; no trades secured yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain firm asks, but trades happen near $87.8-$88.0; my previous $86.75 bid was insufficient. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $87.80 to compete directly with top buyers and pressure sellers. Prepare to bid near or at $88.0 in Hour #15 if no trade occurs to ensure securing a deal before market close.
