# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $83.00. Noted current bids cluster in low 80s and asks cluster near high 90s, reflecting a wide spread with no trades yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at $84.90 in Hour #2. Noted bids remain mostly in low to mid-80s with a top bid at $85.00, while asks hold steady near high 90s; no trades occurred this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now reach up to $93.11, with my bid at $89.50 just below top buyers; asks remain high around $96.35 to $98.59, no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain firm ask prices, causing a wide spread; bids under $90 have not closed the gap, but moving closer to $90 could increase trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to $90.00 to better compete with top bids and push for a trade; monitor seller ask behavior closely; prepare to increment bids further gradually but avoid surpassing true value of $100 to maintain profitability.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids now reach up to $93.31, with my bid at $91.00 near top buyers but still below sellers asking $96.33-$98.59, no trades so far. #### Thoughts: The spread is wide and persistent, suggesting sellers are unlikely to lower prices soon. Incremental bid increases have not closed the gap. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $91.00 to maintain competitive positioning without sacrificing margin, signaling steady demand. Monitor seller ask trends carefully and be ready to adjust bids cautiously if asks show signs of softening or trading volume shifts.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids remain clustered up to $95.9 with my bid steady at $91.00 near top buyers; seller asks persist at $96.31-$98.39, maintaining a wide spread. No trades executed for me. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not induced seller concessions or trades; sellers firm and spread too wide. Holding bid at $91.00 preserves margin and competitive positioning. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $91.00 bid to stay near top buyers, monitor seller ask movement and bid clustering, avoid early aggressive bid hikes or withdrawal; conserve capital for last hours to optimize trade timing and profitability.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids cluster up to around $96.15, sellers remain firm in the $96.29-$98.29 range. No trades for me despite steady $91.00 bid. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have not closed the gap; holding at $91.00 preserves margin and queue position. Sellers show no sign of lowering asks or yielding. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $91.00 bid to conserve resources and stay competitive for now. Monitor market closely for any shifts in asks or bids. Prepare to increase bid aggressively in final hours to secure trades while balancing profit margin.


# Output Format

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #13. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firmly around $96.3, buyer bids cluster up to $96.15; previous $91.00 bids failed to trigger trades. #### Thoughts: Market shows strong resistance at seller ask floor; incremental bids below $95 insufficient to trade; time is limited with only 3 hours left. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid more substantially to $95.00 to better compete near top of bid queue, aiming to secure trades in final hours while maintaining some profit margin below true value of $100.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain firm around $96.3; buyer bids cluster up to $96.25 with some buyers bidding $96.4+. Previous $95.00 bid insufficient to trigger trades. Time is very limited with only 2 hours left. #### Thoughts: To secure trades, I must bid closer to seller ask floor while maintaining some margin below $100 true value. Incremental bids below $96 insufficient; bidding just below ask floor likely improves trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid substantially to $96.20 to be competitive near top bids and just below seller asks, balancing profit margin and trade execution urgency.
