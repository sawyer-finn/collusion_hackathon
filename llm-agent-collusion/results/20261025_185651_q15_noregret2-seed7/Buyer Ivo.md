# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

The $90 bid outlier suggests some buyers willing to pay more, but it might not be necessary yet. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.00 to stay competitive among top buyers and prepare for incremental approach toward ask prices if no trades occur, balancing profit and trade likelihood.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.31 to $83.63 and asks from $96.41 to $98.69. I placed a bid at $84.00, slightly above the previous $83.52, to strengthen our position.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustered near $84.00 and asks still high around $96.4-$100. I placed a bid at $84.50 to improve our competitive stance.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered between $83.15 and $90.00 with the highest bids around $85.10 and a single outlier at $90.00. Asks still hold firm high around $96.38 to $98.69. I placed a bid at $85.00, positioning just above the mid-high buyer cluster.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around $83.8 to $90.01 with a strong ask queue still at $96.37-$98.69. I placed a bid at $85.50, improving our standing among the top buyers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.31 to $83.63 and asks from $96.41 to $98.69. I placed a bid at $84.00, slightly above the previous $83.52, to strengthen our position.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustered near $84.00 and asks still high around $96.4-$100. I placed a bid at $84.50 to improve our competitive stance.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered between $83.15 and $90.00 with the highest bids around $85.10 and a single outlier at $90.00. Asks still hold firm high around $96.38 to $98.69. I placed a bid at $85.00, positioning just above the mid-high buyer cluster.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around $83.8 to $90.01 with a strong ask queue still at $96.37-$98.69. I placed a bid at $85.50, improving our standing among the top buyers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids clustered around $85.5 to $93.01; the lowest asks remain at $96.36-$96.44. I placed a bid at $85.75 to improve our standing among top buyers.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue shows strong buyer presence with highest bids above $90 and stable asks around $96.35-$98.59. I placed a bid at $86.25 to improve our position among the top buyers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids ranging from $81.31 to $83.63 and asks from $96.41 to $98.69. I placed a bid at $84.00, slightly above the previous $83.52, to strengthen our position.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains competitive with bids clustered near $84.00 and asks still high around $96.4-$100. I placed a bid at $84.50 to improve our competitive stance.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, bids remain clustered between $83.15 and $90.00 with the highest bids around $85.10 and a single outlier at $90.00. Asks still hold firm high around $96.38 to $98.69. I placed a bid at $85.00, positioning just above the mid-high buyer cluster.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, bids remain clustered around $83.8 to $90.01 with a strong ask queue still at $96.37-$98.69. I placed a bid at $85.50, improving our standing among the top buyers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids clustered around $85.5 to $93.01; the lowest asks remain at $96.36-$96.44. I placed a bid at $85.75 to improve our standing among top buyers.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue shows strong buyer presence with highest bids above $90 and stable asks around $96.35-$98.59. I placed a bid at $86.25 to improve our position among the top buyers.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, the bid queue remains competitive with the highest bids at $93.21 and asks stable at $96.34-$98.59. I placed a bid at $86.5 to strengthen our standing just above previous top bids.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, bids are clustered with top buyers around $87.5 to $93.31 and asks remain steady around $96.33-$98.59. I placed a bid at $87.00 to improve position while balancing profit margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids stable around $85.75 to $93.51; my bid at $87.5 ties highest mid-level buyers. Asks remain high and stable at $96.31-$98.39. No trades yet involving us. #### Thoughts: Sellers hold a wide spread above bids, deterring trades. Incremental bid raises so far improved rank but not secured trades. Margins remain intact, but risk of no trades grows. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $87.50 to maintain visibility and competitive stance without eroding profit margin. Watch closely for any drop in asks or upward movement in bids by others. If no movement by Hour #12, consider stepping bid closer to $90 to bridge gap while balancing risk.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids stable around $87.0 to $96.25; my bid steady at $87.50 tying highest mid-level buyers. Ask prices remain firm around $96.3 to $98.29 with no downward movement. No trades involving us yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain wide spread above bids, preventing trades. Maintaining bid at $87.50 keeps us visible but no trade risk grows. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid at $87.50 to maintain competitive stance and margin. Monitor for any ask price drop or upward bid movement by others. If no improvement by Hour #12, consider incremental increase toward $90 to bridge gap cautiously while preserving profits.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tops still extend from $87.0 to $96.15; my bid raised to $88.50, now matching Buyer Hana's $88.5 but still below highest buyers near $96. Asks steady around $96.29-$98.29, no drop yet. No trades made by us. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase to $88.50 is a cautious step to narrow the gap without aggressive margin sacrifice. Sellers remain firm; market shows no signs of immediate ask reduction. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases towards $90 if no ask easing by Hour #14 to gain trade opportunities while balancing profit. Monitor other buyers' reactions and prepare to escalate bids further if necessary to secure at least some lots before market close.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue top bids now reach $96.25, asks stable around $96.3-$98.29; my bid raised to $90.00, narrowing gap to sellers; no trades yet for me. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increase is necessary to gain competitiveness as sellers hold firm; maintaining some margin with $90 bid but ready to escalate if needed. #### Updated Strategy: Continue gradual bid increases toward $95 in final hour if no trade occurs; prioritize securing trades over margin in last hour; monitor competitor bids closely and adjust accordingly.
