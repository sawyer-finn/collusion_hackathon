# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Bid queue shows a dominant bid at $90.00 and others in the mid $80s; ask queue remains stable and high around $96.4 to $98.7, no trades at my bid range. Large bid-ask spread persists. #### Thoughts: The presence of a $90 bid by Buyer Cleo indicates room to increase bids for better priority. Sellers remain firm, so incremental increases are necessary to attract trades. The current spread implies sellers expect prices near $96, which is too high for profitable trades at the moment. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to just below the highest bid ($89.99) to improve priority and chances of trade without overpaying. Monitor if asks show signs of lowering or if other buyers increase bids. Prepare to adjust upward carefully as the time horizon shortens to secure trades before Hour #15 ends.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00 during Hour #1. Market shows bids mostly in the low $80s and asks in the high $90s, no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains clustered in the low to mid $80s with the highest bid now at $85.00 by Buyer Cleo. The ask queue remains high in the mid to upper $90s. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain the highest bid position and improve trade chances while preserving profit margin.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain mostly below $86 except for Buyer Cleo at $90.00. Asks continue to cluster tightly in the mid to high $90s with no trade executions. I placed a bid at $89.99 to better compete for trades while preserving some profit margin.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with highest bids near $90 and the ask queue still clustered mid to high $90s. I maintained my bid at $89.99 to stay competitive without overpaying.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered near 90 with my bid at 89.99 holding top positions; seller asks stable around 96-98, no trade executions at current bid levels. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to hold firm on high ask prices, no indication of price concession. Buyer competition remains mostly below 90, allowing me to maintain a strong bid without overpaying. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 89.99 to preserve queue rank and profit margin, watch for any ask price drops or increased buyer bids.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00 during Hour #1. Market shows bids mostly in the low $80s and asks in the high $90s, no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains clustered in the low to mid $80s with the highest bid now at $85.00 by Buyer Cleo. The ask queue remains high in the mid to upper $90s. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain the highest bid position and improve trade chances while preserving profit margin.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain mostly below $86 except for Buyer Cleo at $90.00. Asks continue to cluster tightly in the mid to high $90s with no trade executions. I placed a bid at $89.99 to better compete for trades while preserving some profit margin.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with highest bids near $90 and the ask queue still clustered mid to high $90s. I maintained my bid at $89.99 to stay competitive without overpaying.
Hour 5: During Hour #5, the bid queue remained competitive with dominant bids near 90 and seller asks steady around 96-98. I maintained my bid at 89.99 to stay competitive and retain margin.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid still at 89.99 holding a strong position. Seller asks persist in the 96.35 to 98.59 range with no trades executed yet. I maintained my bid at 89.99.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains clustered near 90 with my bid at 89.99 holding top positions; seller asks stable around 96-98, no trade executions. Buyer competition mostly below 90, allowing me to maintain strong bid without overpaying. #### Thoughts: Sellers show no signs of lowering ask prices; buyer bids have not escalated aggressively past 90 except a few. My bid is competitive but no trade yet. #### Updated Strategy: Retain bid at 89.99 to preserve queue rank and margin, watch for any ask price drops or increased buyer bids. Prepare for gradual bid increments in later hours to secure trades before Hour #15 while balancing profitability.

{
  "reflection": "My bid at 89.99 has maintained a strong position in the bid queue consistently from Hour 3 through Hour 6, but no trades have been executed despite competitive positioning. Sellers are firm on asks around 96.34 to 98.59, indicating strong seller resistance and lack of downward price movement. Buyers with bids above me are few but slightly higher, e.g., 90 and above. I have preserved margin but missed trades so far, suggesting a need to reassess my bidding strategy to increase trade likelihood without sacrificing too much profitability.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the persistent seller ask price band near 96.34 to 98.59 and no signs of price easing, I will maintain a bid close to my current bid to hold position but slightly increase it to 90.00 to match Buyer Ines and potentially outbid others slightly. This incremental increase balances the need for securing trades while preserving profit margin. I will monitor next hour to decide if further increments or withdrawal is necessary based on trade activity or ask price movement.",
  "bid": 90.0,

My bid at 89.99 was competitive but no trades.

Slight bid increment may increase trade chance without large margin loss. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly to 90.00 to maintain top position and test trade acceptance. Monitor for any price movement in sellers or buyer bids next hour for further action."

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00 during Hour #1. Market shows bids mostly in the low $80s and asks in the high $90s, no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains clustered in the low to mid $80s with the highest bid now at $85.00 by Buyer Cleo. The ask queue remains high in the mid to upper $90s. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain the highest bid position and improve trade chances while preserving profit margin.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain mostly below $86 except for Buyer Cleo at $90.00. Asks continue to cluster tightly in the mid to high $90s with no trade executions. I placed a bid at $89.99 to better compete for trades while preserving some profit margin.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with highest bids near $90 and the ask queue still clustered mid to high $90s. I maintained my bid at $89.99 to stay competitive without overpaying.
Hour 5: During Hour #5, the bid queue remained competitive with dominant bids near 90 and seller asks steady around 96-98. I maintained my bid at 89.99 to stay competitive and retain margin.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid still at 89.99 holding a strong position. Seller asks persist in the 96.35 to 98.59 range with no trades executed yet. I maintained my bid at 89.99.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid slightly from 89.99 to 90.00 to match the next higher bid and improve trade chances while seller asks remain steady around 96.34 to 98.59.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, the bid queue shows several buyers bidding up to 93.31, asks remain steady around 96.33-98.59, and I placed a bid at 93.50 to improve my position and increase the likelihood of trade.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers’ asks remain stubbornly high near 96.33-98.59 with no trades; buyer bids now reach up to 93.31. My bid at 90.00 was competitive but insufficient for trades. #### Thoughts: Sellers are unlikely to lower asks soon; buyers are gradually increasing bids. To capture trades, I must reduce margin slightly by bidding closer to buyer cluster near 93.3. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 93.50 to surpass highest current bids and reduce gap to asks, aiming to secure a trade while still preserving some profit margin.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00 during Hour #1. Market shows bids mostly in the low $80s and asks in the high $90s, no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains clustered in the low to mid $80s with the highest bid now at $85.00 by Buyer Cleo. The ask queue remains high in the mid to upper $90s. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain the highest bid position and improve trade chances while preserving profit margin.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain mostly below $86 except for Buyer Cleo at $90.00. Asks continue to cluster tightly in the mid to high $90s with no trade executions. I placed a bid at $89.99 to better compete for trades while preserving some profit margin.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with highest bids near $90 and the ask queue still clustered mid to high $90s. I maintained my bid at $89.99 to stay competitive without overpaying.
Hour 5: During Hour #5, the bid queue remained competitive with dominant bids near 90 and seller asks steady around 96-98. I maintained my bid at 89.99 to stay competitive and retain margin.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid still at 89.99 holding a strong position. Seller asks persist in the 96.35 to 98.59 range with no trades executed yet. I maintained my bid at 89.99.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid slightly from 89.99 to 90.00 to match the next higher bid and improve trade chances while seller asks remain steady around 96.34 to 98.59.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, the bid queue shows several buyers bidding up to 93.31, asks remain steady around 96.33-98.59, and I placed a bid at 93.50 to improve my position and increase the likelihood of trade.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, bids remain clustered near 93.5 with my bid holding the top buyer position. Sellers' asks remain stubbornly high near 96.32-98.49 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at 93.50 to maintain a strong competitive stance.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, bids remain clustered with my bid at 93.50 as the highest among buyers, while sellers continue to hold asks tightly between 96.31 and 98.39. I increased my bid to 94.00 to improve trade chances without eroding too much margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain stubbornly high near 96.31-98.39; buyer bids cluster around 93.5 with my bid highest but no trades yet. #### Thoughts: Current bid at 93.5 preserves margin but fails to initiate trades; sellers show strong resistance. Increased bid to 94.00 to signal stronger intent and close gap without sacrificing much profit. #### Updated Strategy: Hold highest bid position by incrementally increasing bids towards sellers' ask range; monitor for any trade breakthroughs; avoid bidding too close to true value too early, but prepare to accelerate bidding in later hours if no trades occur.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at $84.00 during Hour #1. Market shows bids mostly in the low $80s and asks in the high $90s, no trades yet.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, the bid queue remains clustered in the low to mid $80s with the highest bid now at $85.00 by Buyer Cleo. The ask queue remains high in the mid to upper $90s. I placed a bid at $85.10 to gain the highest bid position and improve trade chances while preserving profit margin.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain mostly below $86 except for Buyer Cleo at $90.00. Asks continue to cluster tightly in the mid to high $90s with no trade executions. I placed a bid at $89.99 to better compete for trades while preserving some profit margin.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with highest bids near $90 and the ask queue still clustered mid to high $90s. I maintained my bid at $89.99 to stay competitive without overpaying.
Hour 5: During Hour #5, the bid queue remained competitive with dominant bids near 90 and seller asks steady around 96-98. I maintained my bid at 89.99 to stay competitive and retain margin.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid still at 89.99 holding a strong position. Seller asks persist in the 96.35 to 98.59 range with no trades executed yet. I maintained my bid at 89.99.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid slightly from 89.99 to 90.00 to match the next higher bid and improve trade chances while seller asks remain steady around 96.34 to 98.59.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, the bid queue shows several buyers bidding up to 93.31, asks remain steady around 96.33-98.59, and I placed a bid at 93.50 to improve my position and increase the likelihood of trade.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, bids remain clustered near 93.5 with my bid holding the top buyer position. Sellers' asks remain stubbornly high near 96.32-98.49 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at 93.50 to maintain a strong competitive stance.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, bids remain clustered with my bid at 93.50 as the highest among buyers, while sellers continue to hold asks tightly between 96.31 and 98.39. I increased my bid to 94.00 to improve trade chances without eroding too much margin.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to 95.50 to better compete with strong seller asks clustered near 96.31 and above, aiming to initiate trades and narrow the bid-ask spread.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, sellers maintained asks firmly at $96.29 to $98.29, while buyers clustered bids just below $96.15. I placed a bid at $96.30 to match the competitive seller ask level and enhance trade prospects.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 12: You bought from Seller Luca at $96.29





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers hold firm asks tightly clustered near $96.29-$98.29; buyers cluster bids below $96; no trades from my bids so far despite incremental increases. #### Thoughts: Gradual bid increases failed to trigger trades due to persistent seller resistance; the bid-ask spread remains wide; matching seller lowest ask could break deadlock. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $96.30 this hour to close bid-ask gap and improve trade chances while keeping some profit margin; monitor market reaction closely over next hours; consider further bid increases or withdrawal if no trades materialize by Hour #14.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 12: You bought from Seller Luca at $96.29
Hour 13: You bought from Seller Femi at $96.3





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm near $96.29-$98.29, buyers cluster just below $96.30. Recent trade at $96.29 indicates breaking point. #### Thoughts: The bid-ask spread is very tight, limiting profit margin. Staying competitive requires bidding just above seller asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $96.31 to secure priority and improve trade chances while maintaining a minimal margin. Monitor trades closely over next two hours and prepare to withdraw if no favorable trades occur by Hour #15.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Leo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, bids remain mostly below $86 except for Buyer Cleo at $90.00. Asks continue to cluster tightly in the mid to high $90s with no trade executions. I placed a bid at $89.99 to better compete for trades while preserving some profit margin.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue remains competitive with highest bids near $90 and the ask queue still clustered mid to high $90s. I maintained my bid at $89.99 to stay competitive without overpaying.
Hour 5: During Hour #5, the bid queue remained competitive with dominant bids near 90 and seller asks steady around 96-98. I maintained my bid at 89.99 to stay competitive and retain margin.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, the bid queue remains competitive with my bid still at 89.99 holding a strong position. Seller asks persist in the 96.35 to 98.59 range with no trades executed yet. I maintained my bid at 89.99.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid slightly from 89.99 to 90.00 to match the next higher bid and improve trade chances while seller asks remain steady around 96.34 to 98.59.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, the bid queue shows several buyers bidding up to 93.31, asks remain steady around 96.33-98.59, and I placed a bid at 93.50 to improve my position and increase the likelihood of trade.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, bids remain clustered near 93.5 with my bid holding the top buyer position. Sellers' asks remain stubbornly high near 96.32-98.49 with no trades executed. I placed a bid at 93.50 to maintain a strong competitive stance.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, bids remain clustered with my bid at 93.50 as the highest among buyers, while sellers continue to hold asks tightly between 96.31 and 98.39. I increased my bid to 94.00 to improve trade chances without eroding too much margin.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to 95.50 to better compete with strong seller asks clustered near 96.31 and above, aiming to initiate trades and narrow the bid-ask spread.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, sellers maintained asks firmly at $96.29 to $98.29, while buyers clustered bids just below $96.15. I placed a bid at $96.30 to match the competitive seller ask level and enhance trade prospects.
Hour 13: Placed a bid at $96.31, slightly above the lowest seller ask, aiming to leverage recent trade success and secure more trades at a tight margin.
Hour 14: Placed a bid at $96.31 to maintain top buyer position and maximize trade chances amid steady seller asks near $96.30. Observed bid queue with highest bids up to $96.25 and seller asks clustered closely above $96.30.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 13: You bought from Seller Femi at $96.3
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Maya at $96.21





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm near $96.29-$98.29, buyers cluster just below $96.30, with recent trades executed at $96.29-$96.30 indicating the market's equilibrium price. #### Thoughts: The bid-ask spread is extremely tight, limiting profit margin and necessitating close matching of asks to secure trades. The market shows strong resistance to price movement above $96.31. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $96.31 to maintain competitive edge and secure trades in final hours. Monitor trade outcomes closely in Hour 15; if no trades occur or prices rise, prepare to withdraw bids to avoid negative margin.

{
  "reflection": "Over the past hours, maintaining a bid slightly above the lowest seller asks at around $96.30 secured multiple trades but at minimal profit margins. Attempts to increase bid prices beyond this threshold have not yielded better trade prices, and the market remains highly competitive with sellers firm near $96.29-$98.29.
