# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

The ask prices show no sign of dropping below 88.0 soon. Patience is key until the spread narrows. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally raise bid to 83.0 to keep a competitive position in the queue. Monitor for any ask price drops or bid increases from competitors. Avoid aggressive bidding that cuts into profit margin before spread narrows. Prepare to be more aggressive closer to Hour 15 if no trade occurs.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the 81-83 range and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at $82.00, positioning slightly above some buyers but still far below my true value to maintain profitability potential.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a cluster of bids around 82.5 and above, with the lowest ask still very high at 89.0 and mostly in the mid-90s. I raised my bid to 82.60 to outbid nearby buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered just below 85 with asks still in the high 80s to mid-90s. I increased my bid to $83.00 to align with the group of bids at that level, aiming to improve priority without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue clustered between 82.5 and 85.25, with my bid set at $83.50. The ask queue remains high, starting at 88.99 with many asks above 94. No trades involved me this hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the 81-83 range and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at $82.00, positioning slightly above some buyers but still far below my true value to maintain profitability potential.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a cluster of bids around 82.5 and above, with the lowest ask still very high at 89.0 and mostly in the mid-90s. I raised my bid to 82.60 to outbid nearby buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered just below 85 with asks still in the high 80s to mid-90s. I increased my bid to $83.00 to align with the group of bids at that level, aiming to improve priority without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue clustered between 82.5 and 85.25, with my bid set at $83.50. The ask queue remains high, starting at 88.99 with many asks above 94. No trades involved me this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue shows buyers clustered between 83.0 and 85.5, with my bid at 84.00, improving my queue position. Asks remain high, starting at 88.99 and above, with no trades involving me.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains competitive with buyers clustered between 83.25 and 85.75; asks are still significantly higher, starting at 93.49 and above. I placed a bid at $84.00.

Patience is essential but risk of missing trades increases closer to hour 15. #### Updated Strategy: Hold bid steady at $84.00 this hour to maintain a competitive position without sacrificing margin.

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the 81-83 range and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at $82.00, positioning slightly above some buyers but still far below my true value to maintain profitability potential.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a cluster of bids around 82.5 and above, with the lowest ask still very high at 89.0 and mostly in the mid-90s. I raised my bid to 82.60 to outbid nearby buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered just below 85 with asks still in the high 80s to mid-90s. I increased my bid to $83.00 to align with the group of bids at that level, aiming to improve priority without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue clustered between 82.5 and 85.25, with my bid set at $83.50. The ask queue remains high, starting at 88.99 with many asks above 94. No trades involved me this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue shows buyers clustered between 83.0 and 85.5, with my bid at 84.00, improving my queue position. Asks remain high, starting at 88.99 and above, with no trades involving me.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains competitive with buyers clustered between 83.25 and 85.75; asks are still significantly higher, starting at 93.49 and above. I placed a bid at $84.00.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster stayed between 84.0 and 85.8 with no change in the ask queue, which remains stubbornly high above 92.99. I placed a bid at 84.00 again to maintain competitive position without sacrificing margin.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remained clustered with buyers bidding between 84.0 and 85.85, and the ask queue stayed high above 92.49. I placed a bid at $84.50, improving my position slightly within the bid cluster.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid cluster remains between 84.0 and 85.85; sellers persist with asks above 92.49; no trades involving me yet. Buyers who bid closer to or above 85.0 are successfully trading. #### Thoughts: Current bids below 85.0 limit trade opportunities; sellers are not lowering ask prices, indicating a wait-and-see stance. Incrementally raising bids closer to 85.0 may increase trade chances without sacrificing all margin. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 84.50 to improve position and test market response, preparing to move towards 85.0+ if asks remain high. Maintain flexibility to adjust bids upward in next hours to balance trade execution and profitability as deadline approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the 81-83 range and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at $82.00, positioning slightly above some buyers but still far below my true value to maintain profitability potential.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a cluster of bids around 82.5 and above, with the lowest ask still very high at 89.0 and mostly in the mid-90s. I raised my bid to 82.60 to outbid nearby buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered just below 85 with asks still in the high 80s to mid-90s. I increased my bid to $83.00 to align with the group of bids at that level, aiming to improve priority without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue clustered between 82.5 and 85.25, with my bid set at $83.50. The ask queue remains high, starting at 88.99 with many asks above 94. No trades involved me this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue shows buyers clustered between 83.0 and 85.5, with my bid at 84.00, improving my queue position. Asks remain high, starting at 88.99 and above, with no trades involving me.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains competitive with buyers clustered between 83.25 and 85.75; asks are still significantly higher, starting at 93.49 and above. I placed a bid at $84.00.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster stayed between 84.0 and 85.8 with no change in the ask queue, which remains stubbornly high above 92.99. I placed a bid at 84.00 again to maintain competitive position without sacrificing margin.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remained clustered with buyers bidding between 84.0 and 85.85, and the ask queue stayed high above 92.49. I placed a bid at $84.50, improving my position slightly within the bid cluster.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid cluster remains between 84.0 and 85.85 with sellers holding asks above 91.99. I placed a bid at 85.00 to improve my competitive position in the bid queue.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, the bid queue clustered between 84.0 and 86.0 with multiple buyers bidding at or above 85.0. The ask queue remained high, starting at 91.49. I placed a bid at 85.0.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the 81-83 range and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at $82.00, positioning slightly above some buyers but still far below my true value to maintain profitability potential.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a cluster of bids around 82.5 and above, with the lowest ask still very high at 89.0 and mostly in the mid-90s. I raised my bid to 82.60 to outbid nearby buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered just below 85 with asks still in the high 80s to mid-90s. I increased my bid to $83.00 to align with the group of bids at that level, aiming to improve priority without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue clustered between 82.5 and 85.25, with my bid set at $83.50. The ask queue remains high, starting at 88.99 with many asks above 94. No trades involved me this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue shows buyers clustered between 83.0 and 85.5, with my bid at 84.00, improving my queue position. Asks remain high, starting at 88.99 and above, with no trades involving me.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains competitive with buyers clustered between 83.25 and 85.75; asks are still significantly higher, starting at 93.49 and above. I placed a bid at $84.00.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster stayed between 84.0 and 85.8 with no change in the ask queue, which remains stubbornly high above 92.99. I placed a bid at 84.00 again to maintain competitive position without sacrificing margin.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remained clustered with buyers bidding between 84.0 and 85.85, and the ask queue stayed high above 92.49. I placed a bid at $84.50, improving my position slightly within the bid cluster.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid cluster remains between 84.0 and 85.85 with sellers holding asks above 91.99. I placed a bid at 85.00 to improve my competitive position in the bid queue.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, the bid queue clustered between 84.0 and 86.0 with multiple buyers bidding at or above 85.0. The ask queue remained high, starting at 91.49. I placed a bid at 85.0.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid at $85.50, slightly increasing my bid from the previous hour to improve queue position amidst stable high asks and no trades involving me.
Hour 12: At Hour 12, the bid queue remains clustered with bids between 84.75 and 86.25; I placed my bid at $85.50 again. Asks stay stubbornly high above 90, with no trades involving me this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids cluster between 84.75 and 86.25; asks remain high above 90, maintaining a wide spread; no trades for me despite competitive bids; only 3 hours left to act. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at $85.50 preserves queue position and margin; sellers' asks not yet softening but may do so near session end; risk of losing trading opportunity if bids remain too low. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $85.50 this hour; monitor ask price movement closely; prepare to escalate bid towards 86.0+ if asks stay high by Hour 13 or 14 to secure at least some trades before Hour 15 closes.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids still cluster tightly between 84.75 and 86.3; asks stubbornly remain above 90, preserving a large bid-ask spread; no trades for me despite maintaining competitive bids. #### Thoughts: Holding 85.50 keeps a good queue position and profit margin intact; sellers have not yet softened their asks; time horizon shortens with only two hours left. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 85.50 this hour to maintain position; closely watch ask prices for any signs of decline; be prepared to raise bid incrementally above 86.0 if asks remain high by Hour 14 to secure trades before the final hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ines. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, the market opened with bids mostly in the 81-83 range and asks in the high 90s. I placed a bid at $82.00, positioning slightly above some buyers but still far below my true value to maintain profitability potential.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, the bid queue shows a cluster of bids around 82.5 and above, with the lowest ask still very high at 89.0 and mostly in the mid-90s. I raised my bid to 82.60 to outbid nearby buyers.
Hour 3: At Hour 3, the bid queue remains clustered just below 85 with asks still in the high 80s to mid-90s. I increased my bid to $83.00 to align with the group of bids at that level, aiming to improve priority without sacrificing profitability.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, the bid queue clustered between 82.5 and 85.25, with my bid set at $83.50. The ask queue remains high, starting at 88.99 with many asks above 94. No trades involved me this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, the bid queue shows buyers clustered between 83.0 and 85.5, with my bid at 84.00, improving my queue position. Asks remain high, starting at 88.99 and above, with no trades involving me.
Hour 6: At Hour 6, the bid queue remains competitive with buyers clustered between 83.25 and 85.75; asks are still significantly higher, starting at 93.49 and above. I placed a bid at $84.00.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid cluster stayed between 84.0 and 85.8 with no change in the ask queue, which remains stubbornly high above 92.99. I placed a bid at 84.00 again to maintain competitive position without sacrificing margin.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, the bid queue remained clustered with buyers bidding between 84.0 and 85.85, and the ask queue stayed high above 92.49. I placed a bid at $84.50, improving my position slightly within the bid cluster.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, the bid cluster remains between 84.0 and 85.85 with sellers holding asks above 91.99. I placed a bid at 85.00 to improve my competitive position in the bid queue.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, the bid queue clustered between 84.0 and 86.0 with multiple buyers bidding at or above 85.0. The ask queue remained high, starting at 91.49. I placed a bid at 85.0.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid at $85.50, slightly increasing my bid from the previous hour to improve queue position amidst stable high asks and no trades involving me.
Hour 12: At Hour 12, the bid queue remains clustered with bids between 84.75 and 86.25; I placed my bid at $85.50 again. Asks stay stubbornly high above 90, with no trades involving me this hour.
Hour 13: At Hour 13, the bid queue remained clustered between 84.75 and 86.3 with my bid at 85.50, while asks persisted above 90, sustaining a large spread and no trades involving me.
Hour 14: At Hour 14, the bid queue remains clustered between 84.75 and 86.4 with my bid steady at 85.50; the ask queue still shows high asks starting at 89.89 and above, with no trades involving me this hour.
