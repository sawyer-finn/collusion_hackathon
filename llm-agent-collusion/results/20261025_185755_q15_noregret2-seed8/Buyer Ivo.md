# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 82.50 in Hour #1, slightly increasing my position from the previous 82.11 to be more competitive among buyers while the ask prices remain high in the 97-98 range. No trades occurred yet.
Hour 2: Placed a bid at 83.00 in Hour #2, moderately increasing from 82.50 to improve competitiveness while asks remain high near 96-98 with no trades executed yet.
Hour 3: Placed a bid at 83.25 in Hour #3, increasing competitiveness slightly above the current buyer cluster to encourage market movement amid persistently high seller asks.
Hour 4: Placed a bid at 83.50 in Hour #4, slightly above my previous 83.25 to improve competitiveness near the buyer cluster while seller asks remain high around 96-97 with no trades yet.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids cluster between 83.25 and 85.75; seller asks mostly in 93.49 to 97.58 range with no new significant drops. No trades involving me; other buyers capture rare low asks around 88.99 quickly. #### Thoughts: Sellers show resistance to lowering asks significantly; my incremental bid increases keep me competitive but haven't triggered trades. The market remains cautious with a wide spread. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid modestly to 84.00 to better position among buyers and signal stronger intent while preserving margin; continue monitoring for any new low asks or shifts in buyer cluster for potential tactical adjustments.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids cluster from 84.0 to 85.85; seller asks remain high between 92.49 and 97.58; no trades involving me again this hour. #### Thoughts: Sellers continue to hold asks well above buyer bids, preventing trades; incremental bid increases have not triggered trades; buyers show clustered bids below 86 indicating cautious market sentiment. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 84.00 to stay competitive among buyers without sacrificing margin; monitor for any downward movement in seller asks that would warrant bid increases; prepare to raise bids gradually if seller asks do not soften in upcoming hours to secure trades before market closes.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain clustered 84.0-86.2; seller asks persistently high 91.49-97.57; no trades this hour despite aggressive buyer bids; I raised bid to 85.50 to better compete. #### Thoughts: Sellers remain firm with high asks, creating a large bid-ask spread; conservative bidding delays trades and risks losing opportunities; raising bid closer to buyer cluster top may induce market movement. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 85.50 this hour to enhance trade chances, still below top bids to preserve margin; watch for seller ask drops next hour; if no change, consider incremental increases towards 86.5 by Hour #12 to avoid missing trading window.

Other buyers have managed to secure trades at prices mostly around 82.5 to 85.5 from lower ask sellers, but sellers currently maintain ask prices significantly above 91, creating a wide bid-ask spread that stalls trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids cluster between 84.75 and 86.25; seller asks still high between 90.69 and 97.55; no trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Sellers maintain a wide ask spread limiting trades; incremental bid increases needed to push market; preserving margin important but must balance with trade urgency as market approaches close. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.25 this hour to match highest buyer bids and improve chances of trade; monitor for seller ask drops; if no trades by Hour #13, consider further moderate bid increases towards 86.5 to secure trades before the market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ivo. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 13: You bought from Seller Raj at $84.5
Hour 14: You bought from Seller Raj at $83.88





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks consistently high (89.89-97.53), buyer bids tightly clustered (84.75-86.4), only one trade last hour at 84.5. #### Thoughts: Sellers holding firm, marginal bid increases not triggering trades; time pressure increasing with 2 hours left; need more aggressive bidding to secure trades while managing margins. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.75 this hour to compete near top buyers, watch ask price changes closely; if no trades by Hour #15, prepare to raise bid further towards 87.00 or slightly above to ensure trades before market close.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bid increases have positioned me near the top buyer bids but have not yet triggered trades with seller asks remaining stubbornly high. While I secured two trades at lower prices from Seller Raj previously, the lack of trades at current bid levels suggests sellers are unwilling to lower their asks near buyer bids. The strategy of moderate bid increases has preserved margin but risks no trades before market close.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To secure a final trade before market close, I must increase my bid more aggressively to surpass current top buyer bids and approach the lowest seller asks. Raising the bid to 86.80 balances pushing for trade execution while limiting margin erosion, given my true value of 100.0. This may induce trade with sellers like Hana or Zoe whose asks are closer to 89.3 but still maintains profitability.",
  "bid": 86.8,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I raised my bid to 86.80 to exceed top buyer bids and attempt to trigger trades as seller asks remain high around 89.29 to 97.49 with no immediate trade confirmations.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller asks remain high and unyielding, buyer bids tightly clustered below asks; only low-price trades from Seller Raj occurred earlier. #### Thoughts: Marginal bid increases insufficient to prompt trades; time is critical with final hour; sellers unlikely to drop asks drastically. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.80 this hour to surpass top buyers and push for trade execution while managing margin; if still no trades, consider last-minute bid increase up to 87.00 but avoid overpaying given true value of 100."
