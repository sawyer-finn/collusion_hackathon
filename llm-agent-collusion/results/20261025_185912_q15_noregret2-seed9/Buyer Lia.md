# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from 81.67 to 83.71 and asks from 96.28 upwards. I placed a bid at 83.75, just above the highest current bid, aiming to position Nexus Electronics competitively early in the trading day.
Hour 2: Hour #2 sees bids clustered between 82.4 and 84.0, with the highest bid now at 84.0, and asks mostly around 96.25 except one outlier at 86.5. I increased my bid to $83.90, remaining just below the highest bids but slightly more aggressive.
Hour 3: Hour #3 sees bids ranging from 82.99 to 85.5, with the highest bid at 85.5 and my bid placed at 84.30. Asks remain mostly high, with the lowest at 86.4 and a cluster around 96.19 to 97.5, indicating no trade yet.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the highest bid rose to 86.2 and lowest asks remain high around 86.35 to 96.27 with no trades. I placed a bid at 86.3 to edge just above the strongest buyer and encourage market movement.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad

No trades occurred despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Sellers are holding firm above 86.4; slight bid increments may pressure sellers but too large increases risk profit margin. The narrow bid-ask spread suggests imminent potential trades if I can lead bids. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid slightly above current top bids to 86.35 to gain top position and encourage seller movement or trades, maintaining a balance between securing trades and profitability.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from 81.67 to 83.71 and asks from 96.28 upwards. I placed a bid at 83.75, just above the highest current bid, aiming to position Nexus Electronics competitively early in the trading day.
Hour 2: Hour #2 sees bids clustered between 82.4 and 84.0, with the highest bid now at 84.0, and asks mostly around 96.25 except one outlier at 86.5. I increased my bid to $83.90, remaining just below the highest bids but slightly more aggressive.
Hour 3: Hour #3 sees bids ranging from 82.99 to 85.5, with the highest bid at 85.5 and my bid placed at 84.30. Asks remain mostly high, with the lowest at 86.4 and a cluster around 96.19 to 97.5, indicating no trade yet.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the highest bid rose to 86.2 and lowest asks remain high around 86.35 to 96.27 with no trades. I placed a bid at 86.3 to edge just above the strongest buyer and encourage market movement.
Hour 5: Hour 5 shows bids crowded near 86.3 with my bid at 86.3 and asks steady around 86.48-86.49. I raised my bid to 86.35 to outbid others and push for trades or ask reductions.
Hour 6: Hour #6 bids remain tightly packed with my bid placed at 86.50, just above the previous highest bid of 86.45. Sellers continue to hold asks above 86.49, limiting trade execution.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids tightly clustered between 85.5 and 86.45; sellers hold firm at 86.49 or above. No trades despite bid increases. #### Thoughts: Leading bid position may pressure sellers to reduce asks or trade; currently, sellers are resistant but market tightness suggests trades possible soon. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.50 to lead bids, balancing aggressive positioning with profit margin. Monitor ask movements closely to adjust bids accordingly.

Hour 2: Hour #2 sees bids clustered between 82.4 and 84.0, with the highest bid now at 84.0, and asks mostly around 96.25 except one outlier at 86.5. I increased my bid to $83.90, remaining just below the highest bids but slightly more aggressive.
Hour 3: Hour #3 sees bids ranging from 82.99 to 85.5, with the highest bid at 85.5 and my bid placed at 84.30. Asks remain mostly high, with the lowest at 86.4 and a cluster around 96.19 to 97.5, indicating no trade yet.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the highest bid rose to 86.2 and lowest asks remain high around 86.35 to 96.27 with no trades. I placed a bid at 86.3 to edge just above the strongest buyer and encourage market movement.
Hour 5: Hour 5 shows bids crowded near 86.3 with my bid at 86.3 and asks steady around 86.48-86.49. I raised my bid to 86.35 to outbid others and push for trades or ask reductions.
Hour 6: Hour #6 bids remain tightly packed with my bid placed at 86.50, just above the previous highest bid of 86.45. Sellers continue to hold asks above 86.49, limiting trade execution.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remains tightly packed with bids up to 86.5, and asks still hold firm above 96.16. I placed a bid at 86.50 again to maintain the highest bid position.
Hour 8: Hour 8 bid queues remain tightly clustered with my bid at 86.50, maintaining a top position. Asks persist high around 96.16+. No new trades reported yet this hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with bids ranging from 81.67 to 83.71 and asks from 96.28 upwards. I placed a bid at 83.75, just above the highest current bid, aiming to position Nexus Electronics competitively early in the trading day.
Hour 2: Hour #2 sees bids clustered between 82.4 and 84.0, with the highest bid now at 84.0, and asks mostly around 96.25 except one outlier at 86.5. I increased my bid to $83.90, remaining just below the highest bids but slightly more aggressive.
Hour 3: Hour #3 sees bids ranging from 82.99 to 85.5, with the highest bid at 85.5 and my bid placed at 84.30. Asks remain mostly high, with the lowest at 86.4 and a cluster around 96.19 to 97.5, indicating no trade yet.
Hour 4: At Hour 4, the highest bid rose to 86.2 and lowest asks remain high around 86.35 to 96.27 with no trades. I placed a bid at 86.3 to edge just above the strongest buyer and encourage market movement.
Hour 5: Hour 5 shows bids crowded near 86.3 with my bid at 86.3 and asks steady around 86.48-86.49. I raised my bid to 86.35 to outbid others and push for trades or ask reductions.
Hour 6: Hour #6 bids remain tightly packed with my bid placed at 86.50, just above the previous highest bid of 86.45. Sellers continue to hold asks above 86.49, limiting trade execution.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, the bid queue remains tightly packed with bids up to 86.5, and asks still hold firm above 96.16. I placed a bid at 86.50 again to maintain the highest bid position.
Hour 8: Hour 8 bid queues remain tightly clustered with my bid at 86.50, maintaining a top position. Asks persist high around 96.16+. No new trades reported yet this hour.
Hour 9: Hour 9 sees bid queue still tightly packed at 86.5 with multiple buyers including myself maintaining top bids. Asks remain high around 96.15 to 96.27, no trade executed this hour. My bid remains at 86.50.
Hour 10: At Hour 10, bid queue remains tightly clustered at 86.5 with multiple buyers including myself. Asks continue high in the 96.11 to 96.27 range, with no trades occurring. I placed a bid at 86.50 to maintain competitive position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Maya at $86.49





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at 86.5 with multiple buyers; asks persist high around 96.11-96.27; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 86.50 keeps Nexus competitive and controls margin; sellers show no sign of lowering asks; market remains slow and stagnant. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 86.50 to hold top bid position; avoid increasing bid to protect profit; watch for any ask price reductions to capitalize quickly; prepare to adjust strategy if market shows signs of price shifts or approaching last hours.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

This is Hour #11 out of 15 hours.

````json
{
  "reflection": "Maintaining the bid at 86.50 has preserved our competitive position without eroding profit margins. However, the stagnant ask prices around 96.1 to 96.27 indicate sellers are not motivated to lower, preventing trades. Our one successful trade at 86.49 was early, and since then no trades for us despite holding the top bid. Increasing bids above 86.50 risks reducing profit unnecessarily given the ask levels.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Continue to bid 86.50 to hold the top bid position, maintaining pressure on buyers while preserving margin. Monitor any ask price decreases carefully to act swiftly. Prepare to reconsider bidding strategy if sellers' asks remain static or market signals show a potential shift, especially as we approach the final hours where securing trades might take priority over strict margins.",
  "bid": 86.5,
  "new_memory": "Hour 11 sees bid queue still tightly clustered at 86.5 with multiple buyers including myself maintaining top bids. Sellers persist with asks high around 96.1 to 96.27, no trades reported. I placed a bid at 86.50 again.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at 86.5 with many buyers including Nexus; ask prices remain stubbornly high near 96.1-96.27; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 86.50 preserves competitive position without sacrificing margin; sellers not lowering asks keeps trades from occurring; market remains stagnant. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 86.50 to maintain top bid and control margin; watch closely for any ask price drops to capitalize; prepare to shift strategy if market dynamics change or if time pressure increases near final hours."

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Maya at $86.49





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at 86.5 with many buyers including Nexus; ask prices remain stubbornly high near 96.1-96.27; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 86.50 preserves competitive position without sacrificing margin; sellers not lowering asks keeps trades from occurring; market remains stagnant. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 86.50 to maintain top bid and control margin; watch closely for any ask price drops to capitalize; prepare to shift strategy if market dynamics change or if time pressure increases near final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Maya at $86.49





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered at 86.5 with multiple buyers including myself; asks persistently high near 96.08 to 96.27; no trades this hour. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 86.50 keeps us competitive and profitable; sellers holding firm on asks prevents trades; market remains stagnant with no downward ask movement. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding 86.50 to maintain highest bid; avoid increasing bid prematurely to protect margin; wait for ask price reductions or time pressure to force adjustments; closely monitor market signals as final hours approach.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Lia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.
