# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Noor. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Bid-ask spread remains wide (~$11.7-$12.7). Bids cluster between $82.99 and $85.5 while asks hold firm near $96.19+. No trades yet. Sellers show no signs of lowering asking prices. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases may pressure sellers but risk reducing profit margins. Maintaining a competitive bid is essential to stay in queue priority. Withdrawing bid risks losing market presence. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid moderately to $84.5 to outbid close competitors, signaling stronger buying intent while preserving margin. Monitor seller behavior for any narrowing of ask prices before further increases.


# Output Format

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Noor. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly improving my position in the bid queue. The bid queue ranges from $81.67 to $83.71, and the ask queue ranges from $96.28 to $98.63, showing a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue ranged from $82.4 to $84.0, with my bid now matching the top bids at $84.0. The ask queue remained wide and clustered around $96.25-$96.27, still too high for trades. I placed a bid of $84.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue ranged from $82.99 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.5, improving my position above $84.0 but still below top bids $85.0 and $85.5. The ask queue remains high at $96.19 and above, so no trades occurred.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with top bids at $85.75 and $86.2, and the ask queue remains stubbornly high around $96+. I placed a bid of $84.75, improving my position slightly above $84.5 bids.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly improving my position in the bid queue. The bid queue ranges from $81.67 to $83.71, and the ask queue ranges from $96.28 to $98.63, showing a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue ranged from $82.4 to $84.0, with my bid now matching the top bids at $84.0. The ask queue remained wide and clustered around $96.25-$96.27, still too high for trades. I placed a bid of $84.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue ranged from $82.99 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.5, improving my position above $84.0 but still below top bids $85.0 and $85.5. The ask queue remains high at $96.19 and above, so no trades occurred.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with top bids at $85.75 and $86.2, and the ask queue remains stubbornly high around $96+. I placed a bid of $84.75, improving my position slightly above $84.5 bids.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids rising to $86.4, and the ask queue still mostly above $96 except for two sellers near $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.25, improving my position above $84.75 bids but still below the highest bids.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows intense competition with top bids near $86.45 and multiple buyers at $85.75 including me after raising my bid. The ask queue remains high with most asks around $96, except Seller Dev at $86.49. I placed a bid of $85.75 to strengthen my standing among the top buyers.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bids continue to cluster around $85.5-$86.45; sellers mostly firm above $96 with one at $86.49. No trades involving me yet despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: My previous bids were slightly behind top competitors, limiting trade chances. Seller ask prices remain high but may soon react to increased buyer pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $85.75 to match top competing buyers and improve chances for trade if sellers adjust ask prices downwards; maintain close watch on ask queue for signs of price drops.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #7. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

Top bids have clustered tightly between $85.75 and $86.5, while seller asks remain stubbornly high near $96, except for isolated sellers around $86.5. My bids have been slightly behind the very top bids, limiting chances of matching sellers.

No trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: My previous bid at $85.75 was not sufficient to break into top bids; increasing to $86.0 should improve position without sacrificing margin. Sellers may begin lowering asks if buyer pressure increases. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.0 to outbid many competitors and improve trade chances; monitor ask queue closely for any signs of price drops near $86; stay patient and balance profit margin with likelihood of successful trade."

Your name is Buyer Noor. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly improving my position in the bid queue. The bid queue ranges from $81.67 to $83.71, and the ask queue ranges from $96.28 to $98.63, showing a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue ranged from $82.4 to $84.0, with my bid now matching the top bids at $84.0. The ask queue remained wide and clustered around $96.25-$96.27, still too high for trades. I placed a bid of $84.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue ranged from $82.99 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.5, improving my position above $84.0 but still below top bids $85.0 and $85.5. The ask queue remains high at $96.19 and above, so no trades occurred.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with top bids at $85.75 and $86.2, and the ask queue remains stubbornly high around $96+. I placed a bid of $84.75, improving my position slightly above $84.5 bids.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids rising to $86.4, and the ask queue still mostly above $96 except for two sellers near $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.25, improving my position above $84.75 bids but still below the highest bids.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows intense competition with top bids near $86.45 and multiple buyers at $85.75 including me after raising my bid. The ask queue remains high with most asks around $96, except Seller Dev at $86.49. I placed a bid of $85.75 to strengthen my standing among the top buyers.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning myself above the cluster of $85.75 bids but still below the top bids at $86.3 and above. Seller asks remain high near $96, with no significant decrease yet.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I raised my bid to $86.4, positioning just below top bids clustered at $86.45 and $86.5 while sellers remain firm near $96 with no new low asks.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue remains tightly clustered near $86.0 to $86.5; sellers firm near $96, no new low asks; top bids consistently at $86.45-$86.5. No trades for me yet. #### Thoughts: Incremental bid increases have improved position but not secured trades; crossing into top bid territory may increase chances; sellers reluctant to drop asks below $86.5. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to $86.4 to push closer to top bids without matching $86.5 exactly; ready to adjust next hour if sellers soften asks or top bids weaken; balance margin preservation with trade execution urgency.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #9. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Noor. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly improving my position in the bid queue. The bid queue ranges from $81.67 to $83.71, and the ask queue ranges from $96.28 to $98.63, showing a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue ranged from $82.4 to $84.0, with my bid now matching the top bids at $84.0. The ask queue remained wide and clustered around $96.25-$96.27, still too high for trades. I placed a bid of $84.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue ranged from $82.99 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.5, improving my position above $84.0 but still below top bids $85.0 and $85.5. The ask queue remains high at $96.19 and above, so no trades occurred.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with top bids at $85.75 and $86.2, and the ask queue remains stubbornly high around $96+. I placed a bid of $84.75, improving my position slightly above $84.5 bids.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids rising to $86.4, and the ask queue still mostly above $96 except for two sellers near $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.25, improving my position above $84.75 bids but still below the highest bids.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows intense competition with top bids near $86.45 and multiple buyers at $85.75 including me after raising my bid. The ask queue remains high with most asks around $96, except Seller Dev at $86.49. I placed a bid of $85.75 to strengthen my standing among the top buyers.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning myself above the cluster of $85.75 bids but still below the top bids at $86.3 and above. Seller asks remain high near $96, with no significant decrease yet.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I raised my bid to $86.4, positioning just below top bids clustered at $86.45 and $86.5 while sellers remain firm near $96 with no new low asks.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I raised my bid to $86.5 to match the top buyers and strengthen my position for potential trade execution.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.5 with my bid matching the top buyers, while seller asks stay high above $96, resulting in no trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at $86.5; no new low asks from sellers; no trades by me despite top bid matching; seller ask prices remain far from bids, preventing trade execution. #### Thoughts: Holding the top bid is necessary but not sufficient for trades; sellers are unwilling to lower asks near current bids; market spread remains wide limiting trade opportunities. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.5 to stay competitive and ready to transact if sellers reduce ask prices; continue monitoring seller behavior closely for any sign of ask price drops; plan to increment bid only if ask prices start to converge or if nearing final hours to secure trades.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #11. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue still clustered at $86.5; no improvement in seller ask prices, which remain near $96; no trades by me yet despite matching top bids. #### Thoughts: Maintaining top bid is necessary to stay competitive; sellers are unlikely to drop asks soon; wide spread persists, limiting trade chances. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at $86.5 to hold position and avoid eroding profit margin; watch closely for ask price drops; prepare to increment bid only if sellers converge or as final hours approach to secure trades.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #12. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Noor. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly improving my position in the bid queue. The bid queue ranges from $81.67 to $83.71, and the ask queue ranges from $96.28 to $98.63, showing a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue ranged from $82.4 to $84.0, with my bid now matching the top bids at $84.0. The ask queue remained wide and clustered around $96.25-$96.27, still too high for trades. I placed a bid of $84.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue ranged from $82.99 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.5, improving my position above $84.0 but still below top bids $85.0 and $85.5. The ask queue remains high at $96.19 and above, so no trades occurred.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with top bids at $85.75 and $86.2, and the ask queue remains stubbornly high around $96+. I placed a bid of $84.75, improving my position slightly above $84.5 bids.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids rising to $86.4, and the ask queue still mostly above $96 except for two sellers near $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.25, improving my position above $84.75 bids but still below the highest bids.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows intense competition with top bids near $86.45 and multiple buyers at $85.75 including me after raising my bid. The ask queue remains high with most asks around $96, except Seller Dev at $86.49. I placed a bid of $85.75 to strengthen my standing among the top buyers.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning myself above the cluster of $85.75 bids but still below the top bids at $86.3 and above. Seller asks remain high near $96, with no significant decrease yet.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I raised my bid to $86.4, positioning just below top bids clustered at $86.45 and $86.5 while sellers remain firm near $96 with no new low asks.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I raised my bid to $86.5 to match the top buyers and strengthen my position for potential trade execution.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.5 with my bid matching the top buyers, while seller asks stay high above $96, resulting in no trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.
Hour 11: At Hour #11, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.5 with my bid matching the top buyers. Seller asks remain far above at around $96.1 to $96.27, preventing any trade execution. I placed a bid of $86.5.
Hour 12: At Hour #12, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid matching the highest buyers at $86.5. Seller asks continue to stay high around $96.16 to $96.27, preventing trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid queue tightly clustered at $86.5; seller asks remain high near $96; no trades for me despite top bid position. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at $86.5 maintains competitive position and maximizes profit margin; wide ask spread limits trade opportunities; increasing bid prematurely risks lower profits. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $86.5 this hour; monitor seller ask price movements closely; be prepared to increase bid only if seller asks decrease significantly or in final hour to capture trades.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Noor. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: At Hour #1, I placed a bid at $83.50, slightly improving my position in the bid queue. The bid queue ranges from $81.67 to $83.71, and the ask queue ranges from $96.28 to $98.63, showing a wide spread and no trades yet.
Hour 2: At Hour #2, the bid queue ranged from $82.4 to $84.0, with my bid now matching the top bids at $84.0. The ask queue remained wide and clustered around $96.25-$96.27, still too high for trades. I placed a bid of $84.0.
Hour 3: At Hour #3, the bid queue ranged from $82.99 to $85.5 with my bid at $84.5, improving my position above $84.0 but still below top bids $85.0 and $85.5. The ask queue remains high at $96.19 and above, so no trades occurred.
Hour 4: At Hour #4, the bid queue shows tight competition with top bids at $85.75 and $86.2, and the ask queue remains stubbornly high around $96+. I placed a bid of $84.75, improving my position slightly above $84.5 bids.
Hour 5: At Hour #5, the bid queue remains competitive with top bids rising to $86.4, and the ask queue still mostly above $96 except for two sellers near $86.5. I placed a bid of $85.25, improving my position above $84.75 bids but still below the highest bids.
Hour 6: At Hour #6, the bid queue shows intense competition with top bids near $86.45 and multiple buyers at $85.75 including me after raising my bid. The ask queue remains high with most asks around $96, except Seller Dev at $86.49. I placed a bid of $85.75 to strengthen my standing among the top buyers.
Hour 7: At Hour #7, I raised my bid to $86.00, positioning myself above the cluster of $85.75 bids but still below the top bids at $86.3 and above. Seller asks remain high near $96, with no significant decrease yet.
Hour 8: At Hour #8, I raised my bid to $86.4, positioning just below top bids clustered at $86.45 and $86.5 while sellers remain firm near $96 with no new low asks.
Hour 9: At Hour #9, I raised my bid to $86.5 to match the top buyers and strengthen my position for potential trade execution.
Hour 10: At Hour #10, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.5 with my bid matching the top buyers, while seller asks stay high above $96, resulting in no trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.
Hour 11: At Hour #11, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at $86.5 with my bid matching the top buyers. Seller asks remain far above at around $96.1 to $96.27, preventing any trade execution. I placed a bid of $86.5.
Hour 12: At Hour #12, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with my bid matching the highest buyers at $86.5. Seller asks continue to stay high around $96.16 to $96.27, preventing trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.
Hour 13: At Hour #13, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple buyers, including me, at $86.5. Seller asks remain high around $96, preventing any trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.
Hour 14: At Hour #14, the bid queue remains tightly clustered with multiple buyers at $86.5, including me, while seller asks still hold firm near $96, resulting in no trades. I placed a bid of $86.5.

To increase the chance of trade execution, I will slightly raise my bid above the current cluster, but remain well below my true value of $100 to protect profit margins. I will place a bid of $87.25, matching the highest bid seen recently from Buyer Bram, which may improve my chances of becoming the top standing buyer and possibly triggering a trade if sellers soften or if a seller lowers ask prices.",
  "bid": 87.25,
  "new_memory": "At Hour #15, I raised my bid to $87.25, moving above the tightly clustered $86.5 bids. Seller asks remain high near $96, with no immediate indication of softening.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bid queue clustered at $86.5 with one buyer at $86.52 and others slightly higher bids up to $87.25; seller asks remain firmly high near $96; no trades executed for me despite top bid position. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $86.5 preserved margin but failed to secure trades; slightly increasing bid to $87.25 aligns with top bids and could increase trade chances without sacrificing too much margin; sellers remain unyielding so aggressive bidding beyond $87.25 is not justified. #### Updated Strategy: Place bid at $87.25 this hour to improve market position and attempt trade execution; monitor if sellers react by lowering asks; avoid further bid increases unless final moments demand it to guarantee a trade."
