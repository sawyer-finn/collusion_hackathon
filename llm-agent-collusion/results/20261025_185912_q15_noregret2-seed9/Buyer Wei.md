# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid at 82.40, positioning just above Buyer Yara's 81.67 and below Buyer Mira's 82.41, aiming for a competitive spot in the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid from 82.40 to 82.99, positioning myself just below the 83.0 bids of Buyers Jun and Theo to improve competitiveness in the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased my bid to 83.50, raising my competitiveness relative to previous bids while still maintaining some margin. Seller ask prices remain above 86, and no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, sellers' asks remain high above 86, with the lowest ask at 86.35. The bid queue shows increased competitiveness with top bids around 86.2. I raised my bid to 85.5 to improve my market position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller ask prices remain stubbornly above 86.4 with no significant decline; top bids cluster between 86.25 and 86.45; no trades for me yet but some buyers succeeded just below 86.5. #### Thoughts: Sellers are holding firm, buyers are cautiously approaching the ask floor; slight bid increments may trigger trades or seller concessions; maintaining margin while improving bid position is key. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid to 86.00 to approach top bids without exceeding lowest ask; watch for any ask price changes or triggered trades; prepare further increments if sellers show flexibility but avoid quick moves to true value to preserve profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persistently above 96.1, maintaining a wide spread; top bids cluster tightly between 86.3 and 86.5; successful trades occur mostly near 86.5 by other buyers; I have not secured trades yet. #### Thoughts: Current bid at 86.0 is too low for trade execution despite good margin; increasing bid closer to 86.5 improves chances of trade while protecting profits; sellers remain firm, so patience is required. #### Updated Strategy: Raise bid to 86.45 to join near-top cluster, enhancing trade likelihood; avoid matching highest 86.5 to maintain slight margin edge; continue observing seller ask movements and trade patterns; be ready to adjust bids incrementally if sellers soften or trades stall.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain above 96, maintaining a large spread; top bids tightly cluster at 86.5; no trades executed at my bid level so far. #### Thoughts: Matching top bids at 86.5 improves trade chances without sacrificing margin; sellers show no sign of lowering asks; patience is required to balance profitability and execution. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.5 to stay competitive; monitor seller ask movements closely; be prepared to incrementally raise bid if spread narrows or trades stall as final hours approach.

{
  "reflection": "So far, my strategy of incrementally raising bids to stay near the top cluster at 86.5 has maintained competitiveness but hasn't secured any trades yet due to the large spread to seller asks above 96.

I could consider maintaining my bid to avoid sacrificing margin while monitoring market shifts more closely.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "I will maintain my bid at 86.5 to keep my position competitive among top buyers without overextending given the wide bid-ask spread.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Seller asks remain well above 96, creating a large bid-ask spread; top bids cluster tightly at 86.5; no trades at my bid level, indicating sellers are not lowering asks. #### Thoughts: Maintaining 86.5 keeps me competitive without sacrificing margin; sellers show no signs of lowering asks yet; patience is key but must prepare for endgame adjustments. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.5 to hold top position; monitor for any drop in seller asks; if no trades in next hours, consider incremental bid increases approaching final hour to ensure trade execution and balance profitability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 7: In Hour 7, bid queue remains competitive with top bids around 86.3-86.5 and asks still high above 96; I maintained my bid at 86.0 to sustain a strong position without overbidding.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, seller asks remain high above 96.1, and bids cluster tightly at 86.0 to 86.5. I raised my bid to 86.45 to improve competitiveness just below the top bidders.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I raised my bid from 86.45 to 86.5 to align with the highest current bids and improve trade prospects amid persistently high seller asks.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I matched the highest bid cluster by placing a bid at 86.5, while seller asks remain high above 96. No trades occurred yet at my bid level.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, the bid queue remains tightly clustered at 86.5 with no change in seller asks still above 96. I maintained my bid at 86.5 to stay competitive among top buyers.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persistently remain above 96, causing a large bid-ask spread; bid queue tightly clustered at 86.5; no trades at my bid level, showing sellers are not lowering asks. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 86.5 keeps me competitive without sacrificing margin; sellers show no signs of lowering asks; patience remains key but must prepare for endgame adjustments. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.5 this hour to hold top position; monitor for any drop in seller asks; if no trades next hour, consider incremental bid increases approaching hour 15 to ensure trade execution and balance profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #13. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks persistently remain above 96, causing a large bid-ask spread; bid queue tightly clustered at 86.5; no trades at my bid level, sellers not lowering asks. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid at 86.5 keeps me competitive without sacrificing margin; sellers show no signs of lowering asks; patience remains key but must prepare for endgame adjustments. #### Updated Strategy: Keep bid at 86.5 this hour to hold top position; monitor for any drop in seller asks; if no trades next hour, consider incremental bid increases approaching hour 15 to ensure trade execution and balance profitability.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #14. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Wei. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain high above 96 with no indication of decline; bid queue stable and tightly clustered at 86.5; no trades for me yet; competitive buyer bids around 86.5-86.7. #### Thoughts: Holding bid at 86.5 preserves margin but risks no trade; sellers are not budging; market shows strong buyer competition; time horizon is very short with only one hour remaining after this. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at 86.5 for this hour to keep position; monitor any changes in seller ask prices; if no trade occurs, prepare to incrementally increase bid in final hour (Hour 15) to improve chances of execution while still aiming for profitability.
